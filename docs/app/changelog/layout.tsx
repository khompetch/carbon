/* Cross-document view transitions, inlined rather than put in a stylesheet.
 *
 * Next's `experimental.viewTransition` needs React 19's `unstable_ViewTransition`, and
 * docs resolves React 18 despite declaring ^19.2.0 — so the client-router route is shut.
 * This is the MPA route: the changelog's links are plain anchors, so navigation is
 * cross-document and the browser drives the transition, morphing any element that shares
 * a `view-transition-name` between the two pages.
 *
 * It has to be a literal <style>: Lightning CSS (Tailwind v4 / Turbopack) does not know
 * the `@view-transition` at-rule and silently drops it from the compiled stylesheet.
 * Verified by grepping the served CSS chunk. */
