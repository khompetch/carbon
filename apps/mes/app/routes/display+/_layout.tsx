/**
 * Layout for the wall-mounted work center displays.
 *
 * Deliberately a sibling of `x+` rather than a child: the `/x` layout renders
 * the sidebar, pin-in overlay, console pill and time-card warning, none of
 * which belong on a screen nobody touches. Reusing `userMiddleware` keeps the
 * same auth, company and location scoping without inheriting that chrome.
 *
 * `CarbonProvider` is the one piece of `/x` that IS load-bearing here. It is
 * the only thing in the app that renews the auth session — it polls each
 * minute and refreshes ten minutes before the access token expires. Without it
 * a display would authenticate once, run until the token lapsed roughly an
 * hour later, and then redirect to the login page and sit there. These screens
 * are meant to hang on a wall for months, so an hour of uptime is no uptime.
