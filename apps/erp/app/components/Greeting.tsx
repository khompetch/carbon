 * A time-aware but deliberately non-canned greeting. `hour` and `pick` come from
 * the route loader (computed server-side in the company timezone), so SSR and
 * hydration render the SAME line — no client randomness, no flash on refresh.
 * The greeting follows the company's working day (the app's canonical calendar),
 * so ensure the company timezone is set correctly in settings. `pick` is the
 * minute-of-day: the same within a minute (a refresh doesn't change the line)
 * but rotating each minute for variety. Lines are declarative (never a question)
 * and only some include the name, so it reads like a person, not a template.
