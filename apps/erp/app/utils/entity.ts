/**
 * The one table mapping a record to the page that shows it, keyed by catalog entity
 * name. Callers arrive with either an entity name (notifications, workflow runs) or
 * only an id (the audit log), so both questions resolve through here — two tables
 * would drift, and the one that drifts is always the one you are not looking at.
 *
 * An entity with no single page of its own is simply absent, and that is a `null`.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `getItemDetailPath` in `path.ts`: that answers a different
 * question — which of the five item routes an item's *type* belongs to.
