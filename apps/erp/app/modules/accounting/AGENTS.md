# Accounting Module

Chart of accounts, journal entries, general ledger, fiscal periods, currencies, payment terms, cost centers, dimensions, financial reporting (trial balance, balance sheet, income statement), fixed assets with depreciation, intercompany transactions, and external accounting sync (Xero).

The reports hub lives inside the accounting module at `/x/accounting/reports` (with the module sidebar; single "Reports" sidebar item), while the report pages themselves are full-screen in their own namespace `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/reports+/` (`/x/reports/{balance-sheet,income-statement,executive-pnl,trial-balance,inventory-valuation}` — bare-outlet layout, no module sidebar; `/x/reports` redirects to the hub). Balance sheet and income statement are multi-period: a Columns filter (Monthly default / Quarterly / Yearly) buckets the selected range fiscal-aware via `computeReportPeriodBuckets` (`@carbon/utils`) and the `accountTreeBalancePeriodSeries` RPC returns per-bucket `balanceAtDate`/`netChange` in one snapshot-bounded journal scan. Trial balance stays single-period (Beginning/Debit/Credit/Ending derived from netChange by account class).

**Inventory Valuation** (`inventory-valuation.tsx`, gated on `view: "accounting"`) is an inventory-subledger report that lives here (not in the inventory module): it renders the `InventoryValuationWorkbench` from `~/modules/inventory` (on-hand value by location/item, as-of date, with a GL tie-out and a **Reconcile** action → `inventory-valuation.reconcile` posting via `createInventoryReconciliationJournal`, gated on `create: "accounting"`). Data/UI live in the inventory module; only the route + hub registration are here.

The **Executive P&L** (`executive-pnl.tsx`) shares the income statement's loader (same period series, consolidation, and translation) but renders a condensed summary instead of the account tree: `computeExecutivePnl` (`ui/Reports/executivePnl.ts`) rolls income-statement leaves up by `accountType` into Revenue / Cost of Sales / Operating Expenses / Other Income / Other Expense / Tax, then derives Gross Profit, Operating Income, and Net Income with margin-of-revenue percentages. A class-based catch-all keeps Net Income tied out to the income-statement root; `ExecutivePnlSummary` renders the fixed lines (no search, no drill-down).

## Key Domain Concepts

- **Chart of Accounts** — hierarchical account tree. Accounts have `class` (Asset/Liability/Equity/Revenue/Expense), `incomeBalance` (Balance Sheet/Income Statement), and `accountType`. Group accounts contain children; leaf accounts post transactions. Scoped by `companyGroupId`.
- **Journal Entries** — double-entry bookkeeping in the `journal` table. `amount > 0` = debit, `amount < 0` = credit. Lines carry dimensions and cost center allocations. Statuses: Draft → Posted → Reversed.
- **Fiscal Year Settings** — configurable start month for fiscal and tax years. Accounting periods auto-created via `getOrCreateAccountingPeriod`.
- **Dimensions** — analytical tags on journal lines (Location, Department, Project, etc.). Entity-type dimensions resolve values from their source table; Custom dimensions use `dimensionValue`.
- **Cost Centers** — hierarchical organizational units for cost allocation via `parentCostCenterId`.
- **Fixed Assets** — capital assets with depreciation. Supports straight-line, declining balance, MACRS, and units-of-production methods. Depreciation runs generate journal entries. See `.claude/rules/fixed-asset-lifecycle.md`.
- **Intercompany** — transactions between companies in a group. `runIntercompanyMatching` pairs them; `generateEliminations` creates reversing entries on the lowest-common-parent elimination entity, classified by `journal.eliminationKind`: `'IC Balance'` (reverse IC Receivable/Payable) and `'IC Revenue'` (reverse an intragroup sale's revenue + COGS and write the buyer's capitalized asset down to group cost — removes intragroup profit from consolidated income). The engine is **capture-driven, not GL reconstruction**: the posting edge functions (`post-sales-invoice`, `post-purchase-invoice`) record role-tagged references (`intercompanyEliminationLine`: `Control`/`Revenue`/`COGS`/`Capitalization`) when each side posts, and `generateEliminationEntries` reads them — so it writes down whatever account the BUYER capitalized (inventory OR a **fixed asset** — the latter is now in scope, was the negative-Finished-Goods bug). The writedown scales by the buyer's on-hand fraction (fixed assets: full until disposed); revenue/COGS reversal scale by the same fraction so the entry balances. `p_regenerate` reverses existing eliminations (reversing entries, never deletes) and re-derives — the workbench "Regenerate" button. Investment/NCI and seller fixed-asset disposal (deferred gain) remain out of scope. See `.ai/specs/2026-08-17-intercompany-elimination-engine.md`.
- **Net Income** — computed equity line on the balance sheet, never a posted account. Uses synthetic `NET_INCOME_ACCOUNT_ID` constant.

## Safety

### Always
- MUST ensure journal entries balance — `postJournalEntry` validates total debits = total credits before posting.
- MUST use `rootSignMultiplier` logic for root account aggregation — Assets/Revenue add, Liabilities/Equity/Expense subtract.
- MUST scope chart of accounts by `companyGroupId` (shared across group) and transactions by `companyId`.
- MUST use `getOrCreateAccountingPeriod` before posting — it checks for closed periods and auto-creates missing ones.
- MUST use `toStoredAmount` / `toDisplayDebit` / `toDisplayCredit` for amount conversion — respects account class sign conventions.

### Ask First
- Modifying the chart of accounts structure — affects all financial reporting.
- Running depreciation — `insertDepreciationRun` creates journal entries that are difficult to reverse.
- Changing fiscal year settings — impacts period boundaries and reporting.
- Generating intercompany eliminations — creates adjustment entries on elimination entities.

### Never
- Delete posted journal entries — MUST use `reverseJournalEntry` instead.
- Manually create a "Net Income" account — it is computed via `NET_INCOME_ACCOUNT_ID`.
- Bypass double-entry balance validation when posting journal entries.
- Delete accounts that have posted journal lines — will violate referential integrity.

## Key Data Model

| Table / View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `account` / `accounts` (view) | Chart of accounts with class, type, and hierarchy |
| `journal` / `journalLine` | Double-entry transactions; lines carry dimension assignments |
| `journalLineDimension` | Dimension values assigned to journal lines |
| `accountingPeriod` | Fiscal periods. `closeStatus` (`periodCloseStatus`: Open→Locked→Closed lifecycle), `fiscalYear`/`periodNumber` (identity from the fiscal start month), `lockedAt`/`lockedBy`. Legacy `status` (Active/Inactive) is deprecated. |
| `accountingPeriodBalance` | Cumulative per-account GL balance snapshots. `closeAccountingPeriod` calls `snapshotAccountingPeriodBalances` inside its close transaction (after the flip to Closed) to write them; `reopenAccountingPeriod` deletes them (`endingBalanceDate` ≥ period `endDate`) before flipping back to Open. Read by `accountTreeBalancesByCompany` (snapshot + delta; full-scan fallback when empty) and `accountTreeBalancePeriodSeries` (multi-period: base snapshot before the range start + one bounded scan bucketed by period ends; single uniform branch). Balance RPCs exclude Draft journals. |
| `periodCloseTaskDefinition` / `periodCloseTask` | NetSuite-style close checklist: company-level task templates + per-period instances (seeded via `seed-company`) |
| `accountDefault` | Default GL account mappings (AR, AP, inventory, etc.) |
| `currency` / `currencyCode` / `exchangeRateHistory` | Multi-currency with historical rates |
| `paymentTerm` | Payment terms (Net 30, 2/10 Net 30, etc.) |
| `costCenter` | Hierarchical cost allocation units |
| `dimension` / `dimensionValue` | Analytical dimensions and custom values |
| `fixedAsset` / `fixedAssetClass` | Capital assets with depreciation configuration |
| `depreciationRun` / `depreciationRunLine` | Batch depreciation processing |
| `fixedAssetDisposal` / `fixedAssetUsageLog` | Asset disposal and usage tracking |
| `intercompanyTransaction` | Cross-company transaction matching |
| `fiscalYearSettings` | Fiscal and tax year configuration |
| `reportPin` | Per-user pin overrides for the reports hub — explicit `pinned` boolean per `(reportKey, userId, companyId)`; absent row = the report's default (core statements default pinned) |
