# Multi-entity accounting, storage rules, and shelf life

> Run several legal entities in one company group, guard inventory transactions with storage rules, and track shelf life.

Multi-entity accounting lets a company group run several legal entities with their own books. A `docs/reference/storage-rules` runs when an inventory transaction posts: it checks the line against a condition you define and either blocks the transaction or warns and lets the user continue; rules attach to items or work centers. Shelf life is tracked on items and batches.
