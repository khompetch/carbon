# Finite-capacity scheduling

> The scheduler now plans against real work-center capacity, with ability-gated operators and an explainable Gantt.

The `docs/reference/scheduling` now plans against real capacity instead of assuming infinite machines and people. Scheduling an operation reserves capacity on its work center, operators are gated by the abilities a job operation requires, and the Gantt explains its placements, so you can see why an operation landed where it did instead of guessing.

## Enterprise SAML SSO

Carbon now supports SAML single sign-on, so your team can sign in through your identity provider. Account linking is provider-agnostic, and the configuration lives in Settings → Security. Two-factor enforcement is also now available on the Business plan.

## Platform exchange rates with per-company overrides

Currency exchange rates are now managed platform-globally, with per-company overrides when your company needs to pin its own rate. The chart of accounts also gained an opening-balances tool for bringing existing books into Carbon.

- Jobs can copy their method from another job, with a version picker for choosing which method revision to source.
- A BOM-level replenishment system and purchasing units of measure.
- API keys can opt in to an accounting delete scope.
- A refreshed app shell for ERP and MES with an inset, floating layout, plus responsive mobile navigation.
- CSV import for storage units, with validation that rejects cross-location and name-colliding rows.

- Purchase order PDFs show the company EORI number below the VAT number.
- Onboarding now presents the Starter, Business, and Enterprise plans.

- Item supersession swaps now resolve correctly across every job-creation flow, so a phased-out part's successor is substituted consistently.

- Items with inventory or cost history can no longer be deleted out from under their records.
- Posting a purchase invoice no longer marks it paid.
