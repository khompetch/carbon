# Automation workflows

> Build automations on a canvas from a trigger, conditions, and steps that notify people, update records, or call an outside service. Plus accounting sync for Xero, QuickBooks Online, and Rillet, financial reports, and scrap.

A `docs/reference/workflows` watches for something happening in Carbon and then does something about it: notify the account manager when a sales order changes hands, open an issue when a job is put on hold, or call your own service when a shipment is posted. You build one on a canvas under Automate → Workflows and press Publish. Steps are cards you connect by their handles, so one trigger can fan out into branches. Every run is recorded step by step in `docs/reference/workflow-runs`.

## Accounting sync and financial reports

Carbon can sync accounting data to Xero, QuickBooks Online, and Rillet through one multi-provider sync engine. A financial reports module arrives with it. Multi-entity companies get a capture-driven intercompany elimination engine: intercompany invoices are posted, matched, and eliminated automatically, and consolidated reports show the group without double-counted internal trade.

## Scrap and unscrap

Scrap serials and subcomponents from MES or stock from the ERP, with a scrap-reason dimension; unscrap restores a scrapped part at its original cost.

- TOTP two-factor authentication, with org-level enforcement.
- MES work center displays, and board and list views for the assigned-to-me page.
- Business dates follow the company and location timezones, with a shared date-time control and a searchable timezone picker.
- Picked-material return timing (at job or operation), and batch splits keep the parent's identity.
- An ITAR certification system covers entity and user certifications, with hardened invites.
- A platform-wide numeric precision and formatting standard. Per-unit prices keep the digits they were typed with.
- Search modal filter chips are ordered by likely use.
- The guides carry real product screenshots.

- Quote line prices are rewritten in a transaction, preserve shipping cost, and an empty rewrite is a no-op.
- Base-currency pricing shows in the base currency on quotes and sales order lines; supplier quotes compare in the base currency.
- Sales order totals no longer collapse equal line amounts.
- Invoice due dates handle End of Month and Day of Month payment terms and populate from the payment term on posting.
- Picking lists honor item supersession, and the default bin is read for the right item.
- Item quantities update in real time, alongside MRP correctness fixes; planning scrap math and MRP double-netting corrected.
- Schedule board updates commit on drop, and pre-assigned work centers survive a reschedule.
- MES: the serial picker only shows for serial parts, multiple batches can be unconsumed, and job operation files are reachable on mobile.
- Issues appear in global search; duplicate issue type names are prevented.
- Change notice notifications go to assignees instead of the whole company.
- Audit log diffs show display names instead of raw ids.
