# Overview

> Carbon is a manufacturing system: ERP for the office, MES for the floor. These are the technical docs.

Carbon is a manufacturing system: **ERP** for the office (orders, purchasing, planning, accounting) and
**MES** for the floor (jobs, operations, tracking). One platform over one data model.

These are the **technical docs**: exact behavior, fields, and operations. If you're new, start with the
narrated `guides/order`, which walks one order from the sales desk to a shipped, traceable satellite.
Come here when you already know the noun you need and want the precise detail behind it.

## How the docs are organized

  - Architecture How Carbon is built: apps, packages, database, events, jobs, and auth.
  - Self-hosting Run Carbon on your own infrastructure — a single VPS with Docker, or your own AWS account with SST.
  - Environment variables Every variable that configures a Carbon instance, grouped by concern.
  - Reference The entities behind the Guide: methods, reordering, routings, and more.

## Build on Carbon

  - Carbon API The service layer — read and write your data the safe way, over HTTP or MCP.
  - Data API Direct table access — the escape hatch, when the Carbon API doesn't cover it.
  - API keys Scoped secrets that let an external system call Carbon on your behalf.
  - Webhooks Get an HTTP callback the moment a subscribed record changes.
