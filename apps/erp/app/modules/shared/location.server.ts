 * screens carried its own copy of this, differing only in where they redirect
 * on failure.
 *
 * The steps run sequentially on purpose: each one usually resolves the id, so
 * running them concurrently would add queries to the common path to save a
 * round-trip on the rare one.
 *
 * The returned id always belongs to `companyId` — callers rely on that, because
 * several run with `bypassRls: true` and then filter only on the location.
