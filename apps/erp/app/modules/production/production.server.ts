// The geometry (assembler) service backs model conversion and motion planning.
// When it's unreachable those actions can't run, so loaders probe its health and
// the UI soft-gates the assembler-dependent controls. Result cached so a
// navigation burst doesn't fan out one probe per route.
//
// The default deployment is a scale-to-zero Lambda: a cold /health takes ~2-5s
// to init, so the probe timeout must outlast a cold start (the old 2s abort
// read every cold service as down). Healthy sticks longer than unhealthy —
// a failed probe usually WARMED the service (the request went through; we just
// stopped waiting), so re-probe quickly instead of pinning "down" for 15s.
