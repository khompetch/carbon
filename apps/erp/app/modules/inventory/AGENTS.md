# Inventory Module

Tracks item quantities across locations and storage units. Manages receipts, shipments, stock transfers, warehouse transfers, kanbans, picking lists, serial/batch/lot tracking, storage types, and traceability (lineage graphs).

## Key Domain Concepts

- **Storage Unit** — hierarchical container (bin, shelf, rack, zone) within a location. Tree structure via `parentId`. Renamed from `shelf` in migration `20260417000100`. MUST use `storageUnit` naming, never `shelf`. Bulk **CSV import** is wired via the shared import system (`table: "storageUnit"`, permission `inventory`): fields `id`, `name`, `locationId`, `parentName`, `storageTypeNames`, `active`; matched on `(locationId, lower(name))` since names are unique per location, parents linked in a second pass. See `.claude/rules/csv-import-system.md`.
- **Tracked Entity** — serial/batch/lot-tracked item instance with `readableId` (serial or batch number), `status` (Available/Reserved/On Hold/Consumed/Rejected/Scrapped), `quantity`, and `expirationDate`. `Scrapped` is terminal but recoverable via the Unscrap adjustment. Batch items have `batchProperty` definitions. A serialized unit can leave stock as a fixed asset: the storage-unit row action **Capitalize as Fixed Asset** (`ui/Inventory/InventoryStorageUnits.tsx`, rows with a `trackedEntityId`, needs `create: accounting`) opens `path.to.fixedAssetCapitalize` with `itemId`, `trackedEntityId`, `locationId` and `storageUnitId` as search params; the `post-asset-transfer` server function then consumes the unit (`Consumed`, `attributes["Fixed Asset"]`, a `'Capitalize'` `trackedActivity`, `itemLedger` −1 `'Asset Transfer'`) at its carrying cost, and **Return to Inventory** on the asset brings the same unit back `Available` at net book value. See `.claude/rules/fixed-asset-lifecycle.md`.
- **Item Ledger** — append-only log of every inventory movement (`itemLedger` table). Source of truth for on-hand quantities. MUST never INSERT directly — always go through service functions.
- **Receipt** — inbound inventory from POs, transfers, customer RMAs (source "Sales Return Order"), or rental units coming back (source "Rental Agreement"). Lines link to `purchaseOrderLine`, jobs, or `salesReturnOrderLine`. Posting creates ledger entries and tracked entities; RMA receipts re-enter at the original outbound cost (shipment consumption rows), current cost for blind returns, or zero when the return reason flags `inventoryValueZero`, and reactivate the SAME tracked entity On Hold (ReturnEntityForm re-tags the Consumed entity instead of minting a new serial). A rental receipt holds no `receiptLine`: each unit is a `receiptFixedAssetLine` with `rentalAgreementLineId`, and posting returns the unit on its agreement and moves its `fixedAsset.locationId` to the receipt's location, with no `itemLedger` row or journal for a `Rental` line (see sales AGENTS → Rentals → Deliver and return). A rental receipt cannot be voided.
- **Shipment** — outbound inventory to customers, or return flows: source "Purchase Return Order" ships supplier returns (Cr Inventory / Dr GRNI at carried cost), source "Sales Return Order" ships rejected RMA claims back to the customer (On Hold entities allowed in lines.tracking for that source only), source "Rental Agreement" delivers rental units: each unit is a `shipmentFixedAssetLine` with `rentalAgreementLineId`, posting puts it On Rent and writes no `itemLedger`, `costLedger` or journal row, and its PDF prints as a "Delivery Ticket".
- **Stock Transfer** — moves inventory between storage units within the same location.
- **Warehouse Transfer** — moves inventory between locations (inter-location).
- **Picking List** — generated pick instructions with FEFO/FIFO ordering and tracked entity allocation.
- **Kanban** — pull-based replenishment signal between storage units.
- **Inventory Count** — physical/cycle count. Posted is terminal (there is no count-level "Rectify" — fixing a posted movement happens per-movement via `correctStockMovement`). Created with an optional scope (`storageUnitIds` + `itemType`) recorded in the header's `scope` JSONB (written at create; not yet read back). `generateInventoryCountLines` snapshots on-hand into `inventoryCountLine` rows, **excluding Rejected AND Consumed tracked lots**. The count **detail** table filters lines by item type / storage unit / storage type / tags / material attributes via the `inventoryCountLines` **view** (line → item → subtype tables → storageUnit, flattened) — the same generic column-filter set the quantities screen uses. There is no material-attribute scope at create time.

## Safety

### Always
- MUST use `insertManualInventoryAdjustment` for quantity changes — it creates proper ledger entries and handles tracked entity updates.
- MUST scope by `companyId` and `locationId` — inventory is location-scoped.
- MUST use `getInventoryItems` (calls `get_inventory_quantities` RPC) for current quantities — never sum ledger entries manually.
- MUST use `generatePickingList` for pick operations — it handles FEFO/FIFO ordering and tracked entity allocation.

### Ask First
- Deleting storage units (`deleteStorageUnitCascade` cascade-deletes all children).
- Manual adjustments on tracked (serial/batch) items — these create/modify tracked entities.
- Changing `warehouseTransferStatus` — it triggers inventory movements.

### Never
- Directly INSERT into `itemLedger` — always go through service functions.
- Delete receipt lines that have posted tracked entities without cleaning up entities first.
- Reference `shelf` or `shelfId` — always use `storageUnit` / `storageUnitId`.

## Key Data Model

| Table / View | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `itemLedger` / `itemLedgers` (view) | Append-only movement log: item, location, quantity, document ref, trackedEntityId |
| `itemStockQuantities` | On-hand per (item, company, location) — a real TABLE maintained transactionally by a statement-level event handler on `itemLedger` (`apply_item_stock_quantities`, attached via `attach_statement_handler`; was a 30-min-refresh matview until `20260812002454`). Excludes `Rejected` tracked stock. Never write to it directly — it is derived state; the nightly `reconcile-item-stock-quantities` cron repairs any drift. Read by the item-dropdown store (with realtime push), the workflow engine's `item.quantityOnHand`, and MRP's on-hand input |
| `storageUnit` | Hierarchical bins/shelves via `parentId`; scoped to location |
| `storageType` | Storage unit type definitions (capacity, constraints) |
| `trackedEntity` | Serial/batch/lot instances with readableId, status, quantity, expirationDate |
| `receipt` / `receiptLine` | Inbound documents from POs or production |
| `receiptFixedAssetLine` | One fixed asset per row on a receipt: `purchaseOrderLineId` (a PO receipt) XOR `rentalAgreementLineId` (a rental receipt; CHECK `receiptFixedAssetLine_source_check`), `received`, `serialNumber`. The rental return fields: `meter`, `notes`, `takeOutOfService` + `outOfServiceReason` (CHECK: a tick needs a reason; the UI saves both as one `outOfService` field), `residualDestination` (`Fleet` / `Inventory`, a `Sale` line only). Edited through `receipt+/fixed-asset-lines.update.tsx` (`receiptFixedAssetLineUpdateValidator`), which refuses a line on a non-Draft receipt |
| `shipment` / `shipmentLine` | Outbound documents to customers |
| `shipmentFixedAssetLine` | One fixed asset per row on a shipment: `salesOrderLineId` (a sales order shipment) XOR `rentalAgreementLineId` (a rental shipment; CHECK `shipmentFixedAssetLine_source_check`), `shipped`, `serialNumber`, and `meter` (a rental unit's meter out). Edited through `shipment+/fixed-asset-lines.update.tsx` (`shipmentFixedAssetLineUpdateValidator`), which refuses a line on a non-Draft shipment. A reader that means a sales order line filters `salesOrderLineId IS NOT NULL` |
| `stockTransfer` / `stockTransferLine` | Intra-location moves between storage units |
| `warehouseTransfer` / `warehouseTransferLine` | Inter-location moves |
| `kanban` | Pull-based replenishment signals |
| `batchProperty` | Custom property definitions for batch-tracked items |
| `pickingList` / `pickingListLine` | Pick instructions with tracked entity allocation |
| `pickMethod` | Default storage unit and pick strategy per item at a location |

## Key Service Functions

- `getInventoryItems` / `getInventoryItemsCount` — calls `get_inventory_quantities` RPC for on-hand quantities
- `getItemLedgerPage` / `getItemLedgerActivity` — paginated ledger history
- `getItemLedgerBalance` — `get_item_ledger_balance` RPC: on-hand right after one ledger entry, on the `quantityOnHand` definition (Rejected tracked stock counts zero). The item Activity feed fetches it ONCE for its newest loaded row; `withRunningBalance` (`ui/Inventory/ledgerFeed.ts`) derives every row's before → after from it as pages load, so paging adds no queries. Run it on raw rows, before `collapseTransferPairs`
- `insertManualInventoryAdjustment` — adjustments with tracked entity handling; wraps the `post-inventory-adjustment` server function, which also maintains cost layers and posts GL journals (5310 vs RM/FG) in one transaction when accounting is enabled
- `getSerialUnitCosts` / `recostSerialUnit` — wrap `preview-serial-unit-costs` (each on-hand serial's carrying cost, `view: accounting`; read by the Storage Units card through `api+/items.$itemId.serial-costs.ts`) and `recost-serial-unit` (re-book ONE serial's FIFO / LIFO layer at a new cost, journal vs an offset account, `update: accounting`; route `x+/inventory+/quantities+/$itemId.recost.tsx`). See `.claude/rules/inventory-system.md` → Serial unit cost and Recost
- `correctStockMovement` — wraps the `correct-stock-movement` server function: fixes a posted `itemLedger` row by booking ONE opposite (delta) movement linked via `correctionOfItemLedgerId`, dated with the original's `postingDate` and posted into the original's accounting period (fails if Locked/Closed). The delta is derived against the movement's current effective quantity (original + prior corrections), so repeat corrections converge
- `getStorageUnit(s)` / `getStorageUnitTree` / `getStorageUnitsTreeForLocation` — storage hierarchy
- `getAvailableTrackedEntities` — calls `get_available_tracked_entities` RPC
- `getReceipts` / `getReceiptLines` / `reconcileReceiptSerialEntities` — receipt management
- `getShipments` / `getShipmentLines` / `getShipmentRelatedItems` — shipment management
- `getRentalShipmentLines` / `getRentalReceiptLines` — a rental document's asset lines with their rental line, fleet asset, item and tracked entity; the `$shipmentId.tsx` / `$receiptId.tsx` loaders call them for the `'Rental Agreement'` source and pass them as `rentalLines` (sorted by asset id, else unit name) to `ShipmentRentalLineItem` / `ReceiptRentalLineItem`. Both readers order by `createdAt, id`: a document's units are inserted in one statement and share a `createdAt`
- `getReceiptRelatedItems` / `getWarehouseTransferRelatedItems` / `getPickingListRelatedItems` — the `DocumentPage` Documents panels (receipt invoices + a sales return's customer; a transfer's shipments and receipts; a picking list's jobs). Query errors are logged and degrade to empty lists
- `generatePickingList` / `getPickingListAvailability` / `getPickingSchedule` — picking operations
- `getDefaultStorageUnitOrStorageUnitWithHighestQuantity` — picking defaults
- `getTrackedEntities` / `getTrackedEntityExpirations` / `getShelfLifeForItems` — tracking and expiry
- `generateInventoryCountLines` — Kysely; aggregates `itemLedger` on-hand into `inventoryCountLine` rows, scoped by the optional `storageUnitIds` + `itemType`. Excludes `Rejected` and `Consumed` tracked lots (status-aware, matching `quantityOnHand`); non-tracked rows (NULL status) always included. `getInventoryCountLines` reads the `inventoryCountLines` view (joins item + subtype tables on `id = item."readableId"` — the same predicate `get_inventory_quantities` uses, all LEFT — + `storageUnit`) so the detail table can apply generic column filters on flat columns.

## Storage Rules (sub-area)

Configurable if-condition-then-error/warn rules evaluated on **warehouse/MES transaction surfaces** (the storage-legal subset of `enforcementRuleSurface`: receipt, shipment, stockTransfer, warehouseTransfer, inventoryAdjustment, place, pick, operationStart, operationFinish, materialIssue, materialReceive). Lives **inside** this module: validators in `inventory.models.ts`, UI in `ui/StorageRules/`; the admin CRUD is the family-parametrized implementation in `~/modules/shared` (see "Service functions" below). There is no `modules/storage-rules` directory — a rule feature is not its own domain.

Sibling feature to **sales rules** (`~/modules/sales`, sales-document surfaces). Both share the engine in `@carbon/utils` (`rules.ts` + `field-registry.ts` + the zod AST mirror in `rules-schema.ts`), the evaluator/violation UI in `@carbon/ee/rules(.server)`, AND the `enforcementRule` table — one table for both families, discriminated by `family`.

- **Rule** — `enforcementRule` row (`family = 'storage'`; the table is shared with sales rules, so every read/write here MUST filter `family = 'storage'`): `conditionAst` JSONB, `severity` (`error` blocks; `warn` blocks until acknowledged), `targetType` (`item` | `workCenter`, enum `enforcementRuleTargetType`), `surfaces`, `appliesToAll` (workCenter broadcast gate) and the `filteredItem*` columns (item scoping). Assignments are polymorphic across `enforcementRuleItemAssignment` / `enforcementRuleWorkCenterAssignment` — `targetType` picks the table. The item table is shared with the sales family: resolve pinned rules against a family-filtered fetch, never a PostgREST embed.
- **Evaluator** — `@carbon/ee/rules.server`: `evaluateLinesForSurface`, `isBlocked`, `dedupeViolations`, plan gate `isStorageRulesEnabledForCompany`. Its item load swallows query errors, which silently skips every broadcast rule — a known gap kept for behavior compatibility (see the comment at the call site). New evaluators must throw instead.
- **One modal** — posting actions return `{ violations, ruleNames }`; callers submit via `useRuleViolations` and render `RuleViolationModal`. Do not fork a second violation UI.

### Storage Rules safety

- The `ui/StorageRules/` components are the **shared** rule-builder surface — sales rules imports `RuleBuilder`, `SurfacesField`, `MessageWithTokens`, `SeveritySelect`, and `ItemFilterSelector` from here by deep path. Changes must stay backward-compatible; parameterize additively rather than rewriting.
- These components must NOT import a module barrel (`~/modules/inventory`, `~/modules/items`, or `~/modules/sales`) — deep file imports only. `inventory` already depends on `items`, and the sales module imports these components for its SalesRules UI, so a barrel import would create a cycle. `StorageRules` is deliberately **not** re-exported from `ui/index.ts` for the same reason.
- `getEnforcementRuleAssignmentCounts` (in `~/modules/shared`) spans BOTH assignment tables — a rule lives in exactly one, so the union of single-table counts is correct. Rule ids are globally unique, so counting by id needs no family predicate even though the item table is shared.
- Never widen the `enforcementRule_storage_surfaces` CHECK to admit sales-document surfaces — that CHECK is what replaced the old per-family enum typing.

Service functions: the admin CRUD is NOT in `inventory.service.ts`. The read helpers (`getEnforcementRules` / `getEnforcementRule` / `getEnforcementRuleAssignmentCounts`) share one parametrized implementation in `~/modules/shared`, called with `"storage"` as the family. The entitlement-gated WRITES (`upsertEnforcementRule` / `deleteEnforcementRule`) moved to `@carbon/ee/rules.server` (`packages/ee/src/rules/service.server.ts`) — they embed `requireEntitlement("STORAGE_RULES")`. Cross-app READ queries `getActiveRulesForTargets` / `getRuleAssignmentsForTarget` / `getStorageRulesList` are imported from `@carbon/ee/rules` DIRECTLY at the call site; the gated writes `assignStorageRule` / `unassignStorageRule` are imported from `@carbon/ee/rules.server` — this module's barrel deliberately does not re-export any of them. Routes: `x+/inventory+/storage-rules*`, plus assignment routes under `x+/items+/rules.*` (item targets) and `x+/resources+/work-centers.rules.*` (work-center targets).

## Related Modules

- **purchasing** — receipts consume PO lines; receipt posting updates `purchaseOrderLine.quantityReceived`
- **production** — job completion posts finished goods; materials issued from inventory (a Make to Asset job completes to `fixedAsset` rows and writes no `itemLedger`)
- **accounting** — a serialized unit moves between stock and the fixed asset register through `post-asset-transfer` (Capitalize as Fixed Asset / Return to Inventory); the `fleetAssets` view joins `fixedAsset` to `item` and `trackedEntity`
- **items** — `itemTrackingType` (Inventory/Serial/Batch/Non-Inventory) determines tracking behavior
- **sales** — shipments fulfill sales order lines
- **quality** — inbound inspections triggered on receipt for items with a Receipt-usage inspection-document assignment
