/**
 * Where a job's not-yet-produced entities hang.
 *
 * A job's real activities are its PRODUCTION EVENTS — `startProductionEvent`
 * writes one per operation per unit, typed "<operation> (<event type>)". The
 * job itself has no `trackedActivity` row.
 *
 * Entities the item event-handlers seed at job creation have no producing
 * activity yet and would float unconnected. Rather than stand up a separate
 * "Job" node beside the production activity — two nodes for one origin — those
 * seeds attach to the job's own production activity, which is what the job
 * node was standing in for.
 *
 * TRADE-OFF: an un-produced seed hanging off a production activity asserts a
 * production event that has not happened. It reads as "this is where this unit
 * enters production", which is why the anchor is the EARLIEST activity rather
 * than an arbitrary one. A job with no activities at all has nothing to attach
 * to, so there the synthetic node is still the only option.
 *
 * Pure and server-free so it can be unit tested; the graph route imports it.
