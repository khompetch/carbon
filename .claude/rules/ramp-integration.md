# Ramp Integration

Carbon acts as Ramp's **accounting provider**. Ramp pushes charges, bills,
and reimbursements into Carbon's general ledger; Carbon pushes its chart of accounts and
cost centers to Ramp so spend gets coded there, and pushes purchase orders + vendor bills
back for matching. EE package `@carbon/ee`, subpath `@carbon/ee/ramp.server` (server-only
service + client) and `@carbon/ee/ramp/hooks.server` (lifecycle hooks). The `Ramp` config
descriptor is exported from `@carbon/ee` (`packages/ee/src/index.ts` `integrations[]`).

The direction that makes Ramp unusual: **coding lives in Ramp**. A customer categorizes a
transaction against Carbon's accounts inside Ramp's UI, marks it "ready to sync", and the
`ramp-sync` job pulls it into Carbon already coded — the opposite of the Xero/QBO/Rillet
providers, which own the data and mirror it out.

> **Live-verified 2026-08-28** (Ramp sandbox, scopes granted). Key corrections that
> came out of it — see `.ai/research/ramp-api-doc-verification.md` for the full record:
> - Transaction **`amount` is DEPRECATED and a major-unit (dollar) FLOAT** — read
>   `entity_amount.value` (signed integer minor-units/cents) instead. The old code read
>   `amount` as cents and understated every card charge 100×. `RampSignedAmount` =
>   `{ currency, value }`; `parseVerifiedRampMinorAmount` accepts the verified integer-minor
>   object shapes, while `normalizeRampTransactionAmount` handles that preferred field
>   and the deprecated major-unit card fallback without conflating their units.
> - Transaction **coding lives on `line_items[].accounting_field_selections[]`** (mirrored
>   in `accounting_categories`), NOT top-level `accounting_field_selections` (which is `[]`).
>   The selection's **type is at `category_info.type`** (`GL_ACCOUNT`/`COST_CENTER`), its
>   `external_id` is the pushed Carbon `account.id`.
> - **`account` (chart of accounts) is companyGroup-scoped — NO `companyId` column** (PK is
>   `id` alone). Four sites had `.eq("companyId")` on `account` and all failed hard
>   (post-charge, pushChartOfAccounts, ramp-sync account verification) — fixed to
>   `id`-only / `companyGroupId`.
> - `getJobDatabaseClient(5)` was poisoned by the accounting sweeps' `pool.end()` on the
>   shared pool ("Cannot use a pool after calling end on the pool") — fixed in `jobs/db.ts`.
> - **Foreign-currency charge** — FIXED + live-verified: Ramp line amounts are in the
>   MERCHANT currency but the header is settlement `entity_amount`, so
>   `buildTransactionLines` scales the lines to the settlement total via the shared
>   `scaleLinesToTotal`. It uses the canonical bounded Hamilton allocator so no line
>   absorbs more than one minor unit of residual; same-currency input is a no-op.
> - **Outbound PO push** — FIXED + live-verified (option B). PO create uses `external_id`
>   (not `remote_id`) with required `currency` + `entity_id` (resolved from `metadata.entityId`
>   or the business's first entity) + `three_way_match_enabled: false`; line items use
>   `external_id` + `unit_quantity`. The PO/bill `vendor_id` is a **Ramp SPEND vendor**
>   (`POST /vendors`), NOT an accounting vendor — `resolveOrCreateRampSpendVendor` matches by
>   `external_vendor_id`/name then CREATES one with the supplier's synced purchasing-contact
>   email + `country` + `state` (US requires it) and `business_vendor_contacts` as a **single
>   object** (plural name, `allOf` of one). **`business_vendor_contacts` AND its `email`

>   email, are each rejected `422 DEVELOPER_7001 "Missing data for required field"`
>   (verified live 2026-09-26). So when `supplier.purchasingContactId` is unset,
>   `loadSpendVendorParties` falls back to the supplier's FIRST emailable contact

>   that blocked the push over a choice nobody had made and that a human would make

>   arrives. Setting `purchasingContactId` still overrides the fallback. Without any
>   fallback a supplier with one perfectly good contact blocked every bill for want of
>   a pointer field nobody knew to set.
>   `describeMissingVendorFields` names the supplier and the specific missing field.
>   **`business_vendor_contacts.email`, `country` AND (for US) `state` are ALL
>   required** — verified field-by-field against the sandbox 2026-09-28:
>   no `country` → `422 {"country": ["Missing data for required field."]}`;

>   email + `US` + `VA` → 200; email + `GB`, no state → 200. So the state rule is
>   genuinely per-country, not address hygiene. `describeMissingVendorFields` names

>   useless "see the provider error" branch).
>   The PREVENTIVE half is the `requireSupplierContactAndLocation` company setting
>   (`apps/erp/app/modules/settings/party-contact.ts`): when on, a supplier must have
>   an emailable contact AND a location whose address carries a country (plus a state
>   when that country is US) before its supplier quote, purchase order or purchase
>   invoice can be issued or posted, so the gap is caught while the person who can fix
>   it is still looking at the document. ONE setting per party kind rather than two,
>   because the platform needs all of it or none — a supplier with a contact but no
>   location fails exactly as hard as one with neither. Enforced ONCE, on the PARTY
>   record, by `checkPartyContactRequirement` (`settings/party-contact.server.ts`) at
>   the six release/post boundaries — PO and supplier-quote finalize, sales-order
>   confirm, quote finalize, and both invoice posts — surfaced as a flash naming the
>   party and the missing fact.
>   It was briefly ALSO enforced as a document field requirement (`requiredContactField`
>   plus six `make*Validator` factories, so `supplierContactId`/`supplierLocationId`
>   became required). That was removed, and the reason is worth keeping: the document
>   naming a contact is not what the platform needs — the SUPPLIER having an emailable
>   contact is — so the field rule asked the wrong question, it blocked editing an
>   existing draft whose optional location was null for reasons unrelated to the edit,
>   and it was absent from all six CREATE actions anyway (they validated against the
>   permissive base schema), so the "every entry point is held to it by construction"
>   claim it shipped with was false. The party check has no such gap: a create is not a
>   release.
>   Off by default, and **turned ON when Ramp is connected**. The mechanism is a
>   CAPABILITY, not a line in the Ramp hook: `requiresPartyContactAndLocation:

## Pieces

- **Config** — `packages/ee/src/ramp/config.tsx`: `defineIntegration` (id `"ramp"`,
  category "Spend Management", active only when public `RAMP_CLIENT_ID` is configured).
  The UI connection is the production OAuth `oauth` block; the form carries no customer
  client credentials. `RampSettingsSchema` is flat: optional `entityId`, account mapping
  (`cardLiabilityAccountId` is the ONLY **required** account — every card journal credits
  it, and it is the one side of the double entry Carbon cannot invent; `statementBankAccountId`,
  `cashbackIncomeAccountId`, `reimbursementBankAccountId` optional — `statementBankAccountId`
  is only the offset for statement payments/transfers, and those families self-gate on it),
  and five sync toggles
  (`pullTransactions`,
  `pullBills`, `pullReimbursements`, `pushPurchaseOrders`, `pushInvoices`, all default
  `"true"`). Renders `SetupInstructions` with the webhook URL
  `${origin}/api/webhook/ramp/${companyId}` — **see "The webhook route" below.**
- **Client** — `lib/client.ts`: `RampClient` over the Ramp Developer API v1. Host is
  `https://api.ramp.com` (production) or `https://demo-api.ramp.com` (sandbox), chosen
  from `credentials.environment`. `client_credentials` grant mints/caches a bearer token
  (`POST /developer/v1/token`, Basic auth, re-mint under 60s remaining). `oauth2` exchanges
  authorization codes and refreshes within the same margin; `buildRampClient` supplies the
  Carbon OAuth app plus an `onTokensRefreshed` callback that atomically persists the new
  access token and expiry. Ramp does not rotate the refresh token. `listPaginated`
  drains cursor pages (`page.next`, `page_size=100`) parsing each row with a passthrough
  zod schema. Errors: `RampApiError` (parses the `error_v2` envelope) and
  `RampRateLimitError` (429 → parsed `Retry-After`); **no in-client retries** — retries
  live at the Inngest job layer. `buildRampIdempotencyKey({companyId, operation, scope})`
  = sha256, a clone of `buildRilletIdempotencyKey`.
- **Models** — `lib/models.ts`: passthrough zod schemas for every Ramp object Carbon
  reads (transactions, bills+payments, transfers, cashbacks, reimbursements, repayments,
  vendors, POs, entities, webhook events, sync results). `RampCurrencyAmount` is
  `{ amount: int (MINOR units), currency_code }`; `fromMinorUnits(amount, code, decimals)`
  converts to major units through the shared precision `round` (`decimals` is
  `currency.decimalPlaces`, never a literal). `RampIntegrationMetadataSchema` is the shape
  stored on `companyIntegration.metadata` (see Metadata below). `RampCredentialsSchema` is
  a discriminated union on `type` (`client_credentials` | `oauth2`).
- **Server domains** — `lib/service.ts` is a stable compatibility facade, not an
  implementation monolith. `connection.ts` owns metadata reads, client construction, OAuth
  exchange and the accounting connection; `chart-of-accounts.ts` and `cost-centers.ts` own
  coding-master convergence; `suppliers.ts` owns accounting/merchant/employee supplier
  resolution; `spend.ts` owns Ramp spend vendors, PO push and draft-bill push/archive;
  `sync-confirmation.ts` owns confirm payloads; `webhooks.ts` owns remote webhook lifecycle;
  and `state.ts` owns atomic metadata/Vault patches. `lib/index.ts` plus the facade preserve
  the public `@carbon/ee/ramp.server` contract. Pure allocation, coding, money and signature
  helpers remain in their named modules. Service-role operations take the caller's client and
  company id; pure helpers do not pretend to require database context.
- **Webhook signature** — `lib/webhook.ts`: `verifyRampWebhookSignature({signature, body,
  secret})` — HMAC-SHA256 over the RAW body, base64, constant-time compare, fail-closed.
  Consumed by the webhook route (see "The webhook route" below).
- **Hooks** — `hooks.server.ts`: `rampOnInstall` / `rampOnUpdate` / `rampOnUninstall` /
  `rampHealthcheck`, registered in `packages/ee/src/hooks.server.ts` under `ramp`. Cloned
  from the Rillet hook shape.

## Auth: signed Connect flow + token refresh

`RampCredentialsSchema` (`lib/models.ts`) retains both `client_credentials` and `oauth2`
for stored-data compatibility, but the settings UI exposes only OAuth Connect.

- **OAuth "Connect to Ramp" (production, primary)**: `config.tsx` declares an
  `oauth` block, so `IntegrationCard` renders a one-click Connect that redirects
  to `https://app.ramp.com/v1/authorize` (scopes incl. `offline_access`). The settings
  loader first calls `issueOAuthState({integrationId:"ramp",userId,companyId})` from
  `@carbon/auth/oauth-state.server`; the random nonce and binding fields live in the
  signed, HttpOnly, 10-minute `carbon-oauth-state` cookie. The callback consumes and
  destroys that cookie before code exchange, rejecting expiry, replay, or integration/
  user/company mismatch with stable `invalid-state` UI copy. It then calls
  `exchangeRampOAuthCode` → `patchRampOAuthCredentials` → `rampOnInstall`. The patch
  replaces only OAuth-owned paths, preserves settings/runtime state, and stores access +
  refresh tokens in Vault. Account mapping happens afterwards in the Details drawer.
  Carbon's OAuth app id/secret
  are env (`RAMP_CLIENT_ID`/`RAMP_CLIENT_SECRET`), read lazily from `process.env`
  in `connection.ts` (never `import "@carbon/env"` there — it eagerly validates
  unrelated required vars and breaks server-only tests).
- **Token refresh**: `RampClient.getAccessToken` runs the `refresh_token` grant
  when an oauth2 access token is within the refresh margin. Ramp does NOT rotate
  refresh tokens, so the `onTokensRefreshed` hook (wired in `getRampIntegration`)
  persists the new access token + expiry only. The OAuth app creds are passed
  into `RampClient` via its `RampClientOptions` (client.ts stays env-free — it is
  client-bundled). Pinned by `lib/__tests__/client.test.ts`.
- **Legacy client credentials**: `RampClient` can still read existing
  `client_credentials` metadata, but `RampSettingsSchema` has no id/secret fields and the
  UI cannot create a new client-credentials install.

## Install / converge (hooks.server.ts)

`convergeRamp` runs on install and every settings save. It validates credentials with
`client.getBusiness()`, ensures the accounting connection, and best-effort registers the
webhook first. A fresh OAuth callback has no required account, so it returns here: it does
**not** push master data or start financial sync before `cardLiabilityAccountId` exists
(`statementBankAccountId` is NOT required here — it only offsets statement payments/transfers,
and each of those families self-gates on it; coupling it here used to block card-charge sync
on an account card charges never touch). Once configured, it validates an optional `entityId`, pushes
CoA/cost centers, and fires `trigger("ramp-sync", {companyId, reason})`. A reconnect whose
atomic OAuth patch preserved valid mappings may therefore converge immediately. The trigger
uses a lazy runtime `import("@carbon/jobs")` because `jobs → ee` is the dependency direction.

- `pushChartOfAccounts` pushes active, non-group accounts as Ramp coding options
  (`POST /accounting/accounts`, `id` = Carbon `account.id`, batched at
  `RAMP_ACCOUNTS_BATCH_SIZE = 500`). The card-liability account is classified `CREDCARD`;
  otherwise `rampClassificationForClass` maps Carbon `glAccountClass` → Ramp
  `classification` (Asset→ASSET, etc.); an unclassifiable account is skipped.
  The POST item is built by `toRampGlAccountPayload` — the Carbon-side `visible` flag must
  never reach the wire (Ramp 422 DEVELOPER_7001 "Unknown field" rejects the whole batch).
  **Every classifiable account is pushed VISIBLE** (`visible: true`). There is no
  `codingAccountScope` setting — it was removed (2026-09-11); the old `"expense"` scope only
  changed a Ramp-side `visibility` flag, never whether an account was pushed or whether a
  bill could be coded to it (Ramp accepts coding to a HIDDEN account — verified live), so it
  only hid the very accounts manufacturing bills post to (inventory, GR-IR clearing) from the
  human reviewing the draft in Ramp. Accounts a prior `"expense"` install PATCHed HIDDEN flip
  back to VISIBLE via their changed fingerprint. Visibility is part of the mapping
  fingerprint. Ramp's native GL-account field keeps Ramp's own label.
- `pushCostCenters` converges `costCenter` rows into ONE custom `SINGLE_CHOICE` field
  (remote `id: "carbon-cost-center"`, `RAMP_COST_CENTER_FIELD_ID` in `lib/coding.ts`)
  whose `name`/`display_name` are the company group's CostCenter **`dimension.name`**
  (the customer's word for the concept — "Project" for a project-tracking customer —
  which also names the Rillet Field). It is a true diff, not a blind post:
  `GET /accounting/fields?remote_id=` (create with **`id`** when absent — the POST is
  idempotent by `id`; PATCH the name only when Carbon's changed since the last push),
  then `GET /accounting/field-options?field_remote_id=` and the pure
  `diffCostCenterOptions` → create (`{ id: costCenter.id, value }` against
  `field_id: ramp_id`, ≤500 per batch), rename (`display_name`, falling back from
  `value`), hide removed (`visibility: "HIDDEN"`, never delete) and re-show restored.
  Tracked in `externalIntegrationMapping` (`costCenter` per option, `costCenterField`
  for the field) with fingerprints. `POST /field-options` is all-or-nothing and
  rejects existing options — which is why the old blind re-post failed on every
  second run and silently never pushed a cost center added after install. It first
  calls `ensureCostCenterDimension`, creating the group's active `CostCenter`
  dimension row if missing (nothing else seeds one for groups created after the
  `20260228024512` backfill). Runs on install / settings save AND as the
  `ramp-cost-centers` step of every `ramp-sync`, so a new cost center reaches Ramp
  within ≤1h.
- `pushProjects` (`lib/projects.ts`, `RAMP_PROJECT_FIELD_ID = "carbon-project"`) is
  the exact parallel of `pushCostCenters` for the Carbon **Project** entity — a
  SECOND custom `SINGLE_CHOICE` field, kept entirely independent of the cost-center
  field. Same true-diff convergence (create / rename / **HIDE** a project that fell
  out of Carbon's ACTIVE set, i.e. a soft-deleted or renamed project / re-show a
  restored one), tracked in `externalIntegrationMapping` (`project` per option,
  `projectField` for the field), and `ensureProjectDimension` resolves the group's
  active `Project` dimension (seeded by the slice-2 migration; it FINDS, rarely
  creates). Runs in `convergeRamp` and the `ramp-projects` step of every `ramp-sync`.
  Inbound: `codeSelections` decodes a `carbon-project` selection to `projectId`, the
  card/bill/reimbursement staging writes it to `chargeLine.projectId` /
  `purchaseInvoiceLine.projectId` (verified by `verifyProjects`), and
  `post-charge` / `post-purchase-invoice` write a Project
  `journalLineDimension` per line — the same round-trip cost centers use.
  `buildLineCodingSelections` emits the project on outbound draft bills.
- Every purchase invoice the sync creates (bill AND reimbursement) gets its required
  `purchaseInvoiceDelivery` row in the same database transaction as the header, lines, and
  mapping — `post-purchase-invoice` reads it with `.single()` and refuses to post without it.
  Standalone invoices use a bare delivery; a single-PO bill preserves the mapped order's
  delivery metadata. The demo sandbox's bills and reimbursements were uncoded when this was
  implemented, so the complete inbound pull still needs live verification.
- `ensureRampConnection` reads the live connections before creating: it ADOPTS an
  existing Carbon one (so the re-install / fresh-worktree case self-heals — this no
  longer needs a manual metadata edit) and REFUSES a seat held by anyone else. See
  "The single seat is contested" below.
- `ensureRampWebhook` is idempotent (skips when `metadata.webhookId` set); on create it
  writes `webhookId` and the vaulted `webhookSecret` together through `patchRampWebhook`.
- `rampOnUninstall` best-effort deletes the webhook, and the accounting connection
  **only when `rampOwnsCodingSurface`** — in push-only that connection belongs to the
  other accounting provider and deleting it would silently break THEIR sync. (It
  reads with `{ includeInactive: true }`; see "Uninstall tears down the REMOTE side"
  below for why that is required rather than defensive.) Then
  `clearRampConnectionState` removes connection/webhook
  ids and the webhook secret without disturbing OAuth credentials/settings/cursors.
  `rampHealthcheck` = `getBusiness()` succeeds AND at least one accounting connection
  is `linked`/`active`/`connected` — held by ANYONE, since in push-only the seat is
  the other system's — AND, **only when Carbon owns the coding surface**,
  `cardLiabilityAccountId` is set (push-only posts no card journal, and the settings
  form does not even offer the field). A connected-but-unmapped
  Ramp reads **unhealthy** rather than a green badge over a sync that silently does nothing;
  `statementBankAccountId` is deliberately NOT checked (its absence is a healthy "that family
  is off", not a broken connection).

## Install modes: `provider` vs `push-only`

Ramp permits exactly ONE connected accounting system. So the customer chooses,
BEFORE consent, whether Carbon takes that seat — and the choice decides which
scopes are even requested, which is why it cannot be changed without reinstalling.

`Ramp.modes` declares both (`packages/ee/src/ramp/config.tsx`); the profiles live
in `lib/modes.ts` (`RAMP_MODE_PROFILES`) and are the CEILING — a settings toggle
narrows them, never widens.

| | `provider` (default, and what an install with no stored mode resolves to) | `push-only` |
|---|---|---|
| `ownsRemoteCodingSurface` | true | **false** |
| `ownsLedgerFamilies` | `[]` | **`["ap"]`** → `ledgerOwnership.ap` is EXTERNAL |
| inbound ceiling | all seven families | **`billPayments` only** |
| outbound ceiling | PO + bill | PO + bill |
| scopes | `RAMP_OAUTH_SCOPES` | `RAMP_PUSH_ONLY_OAUTH_SCOPES` — no `accounting:write`, no `item_receipts:write` |

`rampOwnsCodingSurface(metadata)` is the ONE gate behind every `accounting:write`
call; the list it must stay in step with is in its doc comment. `metadata.syncMode`
is stamped from the SIGNED OAuth state by the connect route
(`api+/integrations.$id.connect.ts`), never a query parameter.

**Ramp has no token-revocation endpoint** (confirmed against `llms-api.txt` and the
OpenAPI spec). A reinstall therefore cannot narrow a previously granted scope set,
so a push-only install may still HOLD `accounting:write`. The accepted position is
that Carbon never USES it — which is why the gate is a predicate over every call
site rather than a reliance on Ramp refusing.

### Verified live 2026-09-26 (`.ai/runs/2026-09-26-ramp-push-only-verification.md`)

On a REAL push-only grant (10 scopes, no `accounting:write`):

- `GET /accounting/all-connections` → **200**. A push-only token CAN read the
  connection list, so peer detection and the healthcheck work without the write
  scope. (This was an open question through the whole design.)
- `DELETE /accounting/connection` → **403 `DEVELOPER_7100`**. The write half is
  refused, so a push-only install cannot tear down the connection — correct, it is
  not Carbon's, and what the uninstall guard already encodes.

### The single seat is contested — `ensureRampConnection` must look first

`POST /accounting/connection` **RETURNS THE INCUMBENT** when the seat is already
taken; it does not refuse. Storing the returned id blind made a provider-mode
install adopt ANOTHER system's connection (live, 2026-09-26): Carbon then believed
it held the seat, and would have pushed masters into that connection, confirmed
syncs against it, shown a green healthcheck, and DELETED it on uninstall.

So `ensureRampConnection` now reads `all-connections` first:

- a live connection whose `remote_provider_name` is **Carbon** → adopt it (this is
  also the documented reinstall / fresh-database self-heal),
- a live connection belonging to anyone else → throw `RampSeatConflictError`
  (`RAMP_SEAT_CONFLICT_CODE`), which the OAuth callback maps to the
  `seat-conflict` error copy naming the two real remedies,
- the CREATE response is re-checked the same way, so a seat taken between the read
  and the write is still caught.

### Connection status is load-bearing — `lib/connection-status.ts`

`DELETE /accounting/connection` returns 204 but does **not remove the record**. It
leaves a tombstone that still carries the old provider's name:

```json
{ "status": "unlinked", "is_active": false, "settings": null,
  "remote_provider_name": "Carbon" }
```

So any business that has ever connected keeps a named, dead row forever. One leaf
module owns the reading of it — `isConnectionLinked`, `extractConnections`,
`linkedConnections`, `resolveConnectedProviderName`, `isCarbonConnection`,
`CARBON_PROVIDER_NAME` — shared by the healthcheck, the OAuth callback and
`ensureRampConnection`, because two of them previously disagreed and the callback's
unfiltered read reported a disconnected system as the current ledger holder.

`metadata.accountingConnectionProvider` is refreshed by `convergeRamp` on every
install and settings save, but ONLY when Carbon is not the seat-holder (in provider
mode it is noise). A failed read leaves the stored value alone — "Carbon could not
ask" is not "nobody is connected". `resolveInstallMode` omits it entirely in
provider mode, where showing a peer contradicts the badge beside it.

### Uninstall tears down the REMOTE side — and needs `includeInactive`

`integrations.deactivate.$id.tsx` deactivates the row BEFORE calling `onUninstall`,
and `readStoredRampMetadata` rejects an inactive row. The whole remote-teardown
block in `rampOnUninstall` was therefore dead code: every uninstall left the Ramp
webhook delivering and **left Carbon holding Ramp's accounting seat**. Both reads
take `{ includeInactive: true }` on that path only; every other caller keeps the
default, because an inactive integration must not sync, push, or report health.

### Mode-dependent UI

Nothing branches on `id === "ramp"`. Two declarative hooks on the descriptor do it:

- **`IntegrationSetting.availableWhen(capabilities)`** — the settings form resolves
  THIS install's capabilities via `resolveInstallCapabilities` and drops gated-out
  settings before grouping, so a group left empty disappears with them. Ramp gates
  the four GL-account settings and the three `pull*` toggles on
  `ownsRemoteCodingSurface`. A gated-out setting's stored value is PRESERVED (the
  save merges over existing metadata) and stays inert because the runtime checks
  the ceiling before the toggle.
- **`resolveInstallMode(metadata)`** → `{ id, detail? }` — drives the read-only
  mode badge, and selects the MODE's own `description` / `shortDescription` for the
  drawer and the card. The integration-level copy is mode-NEUTRAL on purpose; it
  used to be provider-mode copy, which told a push-only customer Carbon pulls their
  charges into the ledger and to map GL accounts on a tab that mode does not render.
  `setupInstructions` receives the resolved `mode` for the same reason.

`cardLiabilityAccountId` is `.optional()` in `RampSettingsSchema` because
requiredness depends on the mode, which the schema cannot see; it is enforced in
`convergeRamp` and `rampHealthcheck`, both behind `rampOwnsCodingSurface`.

**Known gap:** gating `pullBills` also hides the toggle for the one inbound family
push-only still runs (bill payments) — one stored toggle covers bills AND their
payments, and its label describes the bills half. Splitting it needs a metadata
migration.

## Metadata (`companyIntegration.metadata`, id `ramp`)

`RampIntegrationMetadata`: `syncMode` (the install mode — see above; absent
resolves to `provider`), `grantedScopes` (what the token response ACTUALLY
granted, RFC 6749 §3.3, never what was requested), `accountingConnectionProvider`
(refreshed per the rules above), `credentials` (access/refresh/client secrets vaulted and resolved on read),
`cardLiabilityAccountId`, `statementBankAccountId`, `cashbackIncomeAccountId`,
`reimbursementBankAccountId`, `entityId`, `connectionId`, `webhookId`, `webhookSecret`,
`sync` (the five flags), and **`cursors`**:
`cursors.repaymentsRepaidAt` — the only one left. The outbound push cursors
(`purchaseOrderPushUpdatedAt` / `invoicePushUpdatedAt`) were dropped when purchase
orders and bills moved onto the event engine; the `accountingSyncOperation` ledger is
the idempotency now. Values stored by earlier installs are ignored, not migrated.

All Ramp writes go through `upsert_company_integration_patch`, exposed by
`patchIntegrationState` and the operation-specific functions in `lib/state.ts`. The RPC is
service-role-only, takes flat dot-path patch/removal maps, advisory-locks the logical
`(companyId,integrationId)` key, locks an existing row, and writes plaintext metadata,
Vault, `secretRef`, activation, and audit fields in one PostgreSQL transaction. Settings
owns only entity/account/scope/toggle paths; OAuth owns its credential set; refresh owns
access token + expiry; connection/webhook and each cursor own only their paths. Never
reintroduce raw read/merge/write or a whole-object Vault replacement.

## The sync loop (`ramp-sync*.ts`, Inngest)

`ramp-sync.ts` is the thin durable coordinator for `rampSyncFunction` (id `ramp-sync`, event
`carbon/ramp-sync`, trigger key `"ramp-sync"` in `packages/lib/src/trigger.ts`; `retries: 2`,
`concurrency: { key companyId, limit 1 }`). It creates `RampSyncContext`, runs the fixed
`step.run` sequence, totals failures, and notifies. Business workflows live in
`ramp-sync-card.ts`, `ramp-sync-bill.ts`, `ramp-sync-reimbursement-family.ts`,
and `ramp-sync-repayment.ts` (outbound no longer lives here — see below); shared
tenant/currency/file helpers
live in `ramp-sync-shared.ts`. Pure policy and cursor contracts remain in their dedicated
files. Transactional staging/resume lives in `ramp-sync-card-stage.ts`,
`ramp-sync-bill-stage.ts` (with PO-line policy in `ramp-sync-bill-po.ts`),
`ramp-sync-payment.ts`, and `ramp-sync-reimbursement.ts`.
Family modules contain their own failure isolation, so one family does not abort the others;
drain exceptions increment that family's `failed` count and appear in its `error`, while
confirm failures appear as `confirmError` and are included in the coordinator's final issue
total. Durable steps remain, in order:

| Step | Family | Becomes | syncType (confirm) |
|------|--------|---------|--------------------|
| `ramp-charges` | transactions `sync_status=SYNC_READY` | `charge` Charge/Credit | `TRANSACTION_SYNC` |
| `ramp-transfers` | transfers `SYNC_READY` | `charge` Payment | `TRANSFER_SYNC` |
| `ramp-cashbacks` | cashbacks `SYNC_READY` | `charge` Cashback | `STATEMENT_CREDIT_SYNC` |
| `ramp-bills` | bills (`sync_ready`, not-synced) | posted `purchaseInvoice` | `BILL_SYNC` |
| `ramp-bill-payments` | paid bills' `payment` | AP `payment` + `invoiceSettlement` | `BILL_PAYMENT_SYNC` |
| `ramp-reimbursements` | reimbursements `SYNC_READY` | Draft `reimbursement` (employee party) | `REIMBURSEMENT_SYNC` |
| `ramp-repayments` | repayments (`from_repaid_at` cursor) | `charge` Repayment | *(no Ramp confirm)* |
| `ramp-subscriptions` | — | converges Ramp's SYNC event subscriptions (self-healing, mirrors the accounting outbound sweep) | *(n/a)* |
| `ramp-outbound-reconcile` | released POs + posted invoices in the sweep window | ledger operations, then a drain | *(n/a)* |

**Outbound pushes run on the shared event engine, not a bespoke cursor sweep.**
Purchase orders and draft bills go through `event-handler-sync` →
`reconcileEntities` → `drainSyncOperations` → `SyncFactory` — see "Outbound: on
the event engine" below. `ramp-outbound-reconcile` is that path's **correctness
guarantee**, and the other half of `ramp-subscriptions`: converging the
subscriptions only fixes the NEXT event, so a purchase order released or an
invoice posted while the rows were missing has no ledger operation and nothing
would ever look for it (the accounting outbound sweep walks `ProviderID` only, so
it never reaches Ramp). The step therefore repeats the accounting sweep's
convergence-then-walk over the same `SWEEP_LOOKBACK_DAYS` window, gating each
candidate walk on the PROVIDER's own config (`pushPurchaseOrders` /
`pushInvoices` plus the mode ceiling) — `loadRampOutboundCandidates` in
`ramp-sync-outbound.ts`. It runs after the coding-master pushes, because a bill
pushed before its accounts and cost centers exist in Ramp arrives uncoded, and
history older than the window stays a backfill's job rather than a silent
mass-push.

Card families use `stageOrResumeRampCharge` to advisory-lock the company/Ramp id
and atomically create or resume the **Draft** `charge`, lines, and mapping before
posting it through `post-charge`. A missing or ambiguous edge response succeeds
only when a tenant-scoped reread observes `Posted`; Ramp receipts are then stored on the
Carbon transaction best-effort. A mapped Draft is refreshed from the latest validated Ramp
header and coding in that same transaction; a failed refresh rolls back, and Posted rows
remain immutable. Bills likewise use `stageOrResumeRampBill` to atomically
stage the supplier interaction, Draft `purchaseInvoice`, delivery, lines, and mapping
before `post-purchase-invoice`; an ambiguous response is accepted only after observing
`Posted`. Bill payments delegate to
`syncRampBillPayment` in `ramp-sync-payment.ts`: the Draft payment, settlement, and Ramp
mapping are staged atomically, the stored source-FX snapshot is retained on resume, and
success requires a tenant-scoped reread showing Posted. Reimbursements delegate to
`createRampReimbursement` in `ramp-sync-reimbursement.ts`: a company/Ramp-id advisory lock
serializes the atomic `reimbursement` header + lines + mapping stage. The document is its
own Carbon type, NOT a purchase invoice to an "Employee" supplier, and it lands **Draft** —
nothing auto-posts, so no settlement is written at import. The mapping entity type is
`reimbursement` (`RAMP_REIMBURSEMENT_ENTITY_TYPE`), not `bill`.

**Sync creates, and never re-writes.** An already-mapped reimbursement returns its existing
row untouched, so a reviewer's edits survive a re-sync. The ONE exception is the payout
intent on the mapping metadata, which is additive-only: a reimbursement imported while
`APPROVED` that Ramp later PAYS would otherwise keep a payout-less mapping forever and
Post would never create the `payment`/`invoiceSettlement`. Mapping bookkeeping is not a
document re-write — nobody edits it — and an intent already recorded carries the FX
snapshot of the payout that really happened and is never overwritten
(`hasRecordedPayout`, keyed on `rampPaymentId`).

Ramp line amounts are in MERCHANT currency while the header is the SETTLEMENT amount, so
`scaleLinesToTotal` applies here as it does for cards; unscaled lines would not sum to the
header and `requireLineSum` would block Post forever. All writes attribute to `"system"`. Gating: `metadata.sync.pull*` flags;
`cardLiabilityAccountId` (required for
every card family); `statementBankAccountId` (transfers, bill payments, repayments);
`cashbackIncomeAccountId` (cashbacks). A configured `entityId` is enforced locally on
every inbound row before mapping or writes; only endpoints with a verified query contract
receive the remote `entity_id` filter. Amounts use their verified wire shape: signed and
currency amounts are integer minor units, while the deprecated transaction `amount` fallback
is a major-unit decimal. Missing, non-finite, fractional-minor, currency-mismatched, or
ambiguous values fail that item instead of becoming zero. The currency's authoritative
`decimalPlaces` is read once per code and cached.

**FX (foreign-per-base convention).** `exchangeRate` everywhere here is the
`get_exchange_rate` foreign-per-base rate (`getRampExchangeRate(ctx, code)`, cached;
base → 1). A missing/invalid currency precision or exchange rate fails the affected
item; Ramp sync never guesses two decimals or posts foreign currency at par. The card
journal converts document→base by DIVIDING via the shared `toBaseAmount`
(`build-charge-journal.ts`) — NOT multiplying. Standalone inbound bill and
reimbursement lines use quantity one and write the document amount to
`purchaseInvoiceLine.supplierUnitPrice`; a linked-PO bill preserves its covered quantity and
stores `supplierUnitPrice = document amount / covered quantity`. Both forms store the
resolved `exchangeRate` on header and lines (NEVER write the generated `unitPrice`/
`totalAmount`, which are `supplier* / exchangeRate`); `post-purchase-invoice` then posts the
generated base `unitPrice`.
Outbound pushes send DOCUMENT currency under the `currency`/`invoice_currency`
label — PO push uses `purchaseOrderLine.supplierUnitPrice` (already document),
the draft-bill push converts the generated base line `totalAmount` back to document
currency via `toDocumentAmount(total, rate, decimals)`. Its foreign-currency path requires a
finite positive stored invoice rate; only base currency uses rate one.

Coding: `codeSelections` (pure, `packages/ee/src/ramp/lib/coding.ts`, unit-tested) reads a
Ramp `accounting_field_selections` list — the first `category_info.type === "GL_ACCOUNT"`
selection's `external_id` (the Carbon `account.id` Carbon pushed) wins for the account; the
first selection whose **`category_info.external_id === "carbon-cost-center"`** wins for the
cost center. A CUSTOM field has no `type` at creation, so its selections come back typed
`OTHER` — matching the native `COST_CENTER` enum (what the code did until 2026-09-10)
never fires and dropped every project tag silently. A line coded to an account Carbon
can't find (verified against `account` in one `.in()` query) — or to a cost center Carbon
can't find (`verifyCostCenters`, one company-scoped `.in()` query) — fails that item as
"uncoded" without creating anything; the tag is never dropped.

`buildLineCodingSelections` (same file, unit-tested) is the OUTBOUND mirror: it builds the
draft-bill line's `accounting_field_selections` WRITE shape
(`{ field_external_id, field_option_external_id }`) — GL account on `"Category"`, cost
center on `"carbon-cost-center"`, option ids `account.id`/`costCenter.id`. What it writes
reads back through `codeSelections` as the same ids (round-trip pinned by the test).

### Confirm semantics (`confirmSyncs`)

After each card/bill/reimbursement family drains, it `POST /accounting/syncs` (body built by
the pure `buildSyncConfirmBody`) with `sync_type`, an idempotency key (`buildRampIdempotencyKey` over
`(companyId, syncType, sha256(sorted ids))` — a retried confirm can't double-apply),
`successful_syncs` (`{id, reference_id, deep_link_url?}`), and `failed_syncs`
(`{ id, error: { message } }` — Ramp's item shape; `{id, message}` is a 422). **Both lists have
`minItems: 1`: an empty list must be OMITTED, never sent as `[]`** — until 2026-09-10 every
confirm 422'd on one of these and was only `console.error`'d, so synced transactions stayed
`SYNC_READY` in Ramp forever and were re-listed each run. A confirm failure now also lands on
the family's step output as `confirmError`. A family confirms whatever it managed to gather
**even if its own drain threw partway** (the confirm is outside the drain's try/catch). An
empty batch is skipped.
**Repayments have no Ramp confirm** — their idempotency IS the
`externalIntegrationMapping` / the cursor. The outbound families left this job entirely.

### Idempotency (mapping-guarded)

An already-synced Ramp item is detected via its `externalIntegrationMapping` and
re-confirmed only, never re-created. `mapping.link(...)` is written **before** the confirm,
so a retry (SYNC_READY still lists the item until Ramp records the confirm) short-circuits
on the mapping. Entity-type reuse per family: card families → `charge`
(repayments key it as `repayment:<id>`); bills + reimbursements → `bill` (distinct id
spaces); bill payments → `payment`.

### Dedupe / short-circuit rules

- **Bills** (`syncBill`): a company/Ramp-id advisory lock serializes the atomic staging
  transaction. Carbon-born `bill.remote_id` may identify an existing invoice, and a legacy
  `(supplierId, supplierReference)` match is adopted only when it identifies one untracked
  Draft; a posted reference collision fails closed. A bill tied entirely to one mapped
  Carbon PO stages from that PO with exact line provenance and quantity reconciliation,
  respecting existing reservations. Multi-PO bills deliberately stage as standalone
  invoices instead of guessing a conversion target.
- **Bill payments** (`syncBillPayment`): a bill paid by a **Ramp card** (`payment_method`
  in `CARD_PAYMENT_METHODS`) is **confirmed WITHOUT posting an AP payment** — the card
  spend already routes through the charge sync, so posting a payment would
  double-count. Card methods include `ONE_TIME_CARD_DELIVERY`. Only the verified bank rails
  `ACH`, `CHECK`, `DIRECT_DEBIT`, `DOMESTIC_WIRE`, `FED_NOW`, `INTERNATIONAL`,
  `LOCAL_BANK_TRANSFER`, `RTP`, and `SWIFT` post an AP payment. Missing/unknown methods,
  `PAID_MANUALLY`, `VENDOR_CREDIT`, crypto, and `UNSPECIFIED` fail visibly rather than
  guessing the statement bank account.
- **Reimbursements**: every supported state now creates a **Draft** `reimbursement` and
  confirms — nothing auto-posts, so confirmation no longer waits on a posted settlement.
  `REIMBURSED` and `REIMBURSED_VIA_PUSH` additionally record a payout INTENT on the mapping
  metadata, which the ERP's Post helper turns into the `payment` + `invoiceSettlement`.
  `APPROVED`, `AWAITING_PAYMENT`, `AWAITING_PUSH_PAYMENT` and `MANUALLY_REIMBURSED` record
  no intent. Other states fail before writes.
  Legacy adoption requires exactly one unposted, system-created Draft with the expected
  `RAMP-REIMB-<id>` reference, supplier interaction, complete delivery/lines, matching dates,
  currency, amounts and coding, valid preserved FX, zero tax/shipping, and no PO/item/asset
  provenance. Incomplete or ambiguous reference matches are rejected without repair;
  an existing mapping remains the authoritative resume identity.
- **Suppliers** (`resolveRampSupplier`): mapping-first (`vendor` entityType) → case-
  insensitive exact `supplier.name` match → auto-create. Repayment users still resolve to an
  "Employee" `supplierType` supplier this way. **Reimbursements no longer do**:
  `resolveReimbursementEmployee` matches the Ramp user's email to an `employee` row and
  writes the reimbursement's employee party directly. Zero matches fails with a named
  error and more than one fails as ambiguous — it never auto-creates an employee, because
  a wrong match pays the wrong person.

### Repayments (cursor-driven)

There is no Ramp confirm for repayments, so the `metadata.cursors.repaymentsRepaidAt`
high-water mark controls replay and the `repayment:<id>` mapping prevents duplicates.
`computeRepaymentCursor` advances to
`min(max(processed), min(failed) − 1s)` so a failed item is re-listed next sweep — the
cursor only advances over provably-covered work. Each repayment scales its ORIGINAL card
transaction's coding lines by `repaymentAmount / originalAmount` via the pure
`scaleRepaymentLines` (the canonical bounded allocator distributes residual by largest
remainder so lines sum exactly to the header without distorting one line). A nonzero
repayment with no source basis is rejected rather than fabricated. The API's funding field
is a free string; only its documented lowercase `ach` value is supported, using the statement
bank offset. Missing or unverified funding (including `STATEMENT_CREDIT`) fails visibly and
holds the cursor before that item instead of selecting an account by fallback.

### Outbound: on the event engine

Purchase orders and draft bills push through the SAME event engine, ledger, reconciler and
drain as the accounting providers — `event-handler-sync` → `reconcileEntities` →
`drainSyncOperations` → `SyncFactory`. The cursor-paged `ramp-sync-outbound` sweep, its
keyset helpers and its two metadata cursors are gone.

- **Ramp is a `SyncProvider`.** `RampProvider` (`ee/src/ramp/lib/provider.ts`) declares
  `role: "spend"` capabilities and resolves its sync config through `buildSpendSyncConfig`
  (`ee/src/spend/sync-config.ts`), which starts from everything disabled and enables only
  what a ceiling AND the stored `pushPurchaseOrders` / `pushInvoices` toggles permit. The
  ceiling always wins — that is what push-only mode will constrain.
- **The Carbon-side half is provider-neutral and lives in `ee/src/spend/`** — the same
  convention the accounting providers use (`document-costing.ts`,
  `sales-invoice-source.ts`, `card-charge-source.ts` each feed three adapters):
  `push-only-syncer.ts`, `parties.ts` (supplier / purchasing contact / address),
  `purchase-order-source.ts`, `bill-source.ts`, `gates.ts` (eligibility) and
  `sync-config.ts`. Adding a second spend platform means writing adapters, not
  re-deriving any of this.
- **The WIRE lives in `ee/src/ramp/entities/`** (`purchase-order.ts`, `bill.ts`),
  registered with `SyncFactory` under `SpendProviderID.RAMP` by `entities/index.ts`.
  `@carbon/jobs` side-effect-imports `@carbon/ee/ramp/entities` from `sync-provider.ts`
  so the registration runs; without it the drain resolves a provider with no registry.
  Rules that are genuinely Ramp's stay here and say so — the draft bill is create-once
  BECAUSE a Ramp draft has no delete endpoint, so a platform that can retract one could
  update instead.
- **`resolveSyncProvider`** (`jobs/.../integrations/sync-provider.ts`) is the ONE place
  that branches accounting vs spend. The event handler and drain call it instead of
  assuming every provider id is an accounting provider.
- **Subscriptions**: `REQUIRED_SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS[ramp]` = `purchaseOrder` +
  `purchaseInvoice`, INSERT/UPDATE only. Converged by the install/update hooks and by the
  `ramp-subscriptions` step of `ramp-sync`, so existing installs self-heal.
- **A bill reads the `purchaseInvoices` VIEW, not the table** (`spend/bill-source.ts`).
  The view derives status: a fully settled invoice reads `Paid` there while the table
  still stores `Open`, and `Partially Paid`/`Overdue` exist only in the view. Reading the
  table would hand Ramp bills that are already paid. Pinned by `spend/gates.test.ts`.
- **A PO line pushes `supplierUnitPrice` (document currency), never the generated
  `unitPrice`** (company base), and `currencyCode` falls back to the company's base
  currency — it is NULL on an order raised in the company's own currency and Ramp
  requires a currency on create. Both live-verified 2026-09-25.
- A Carbon purchase invoice can carry both a `rillet`/`bill` and a `ramp`/`bill` operation
  — the ledger key is `(companyId, integration, entityType, entityId)`.

- **`purchase_order_number` is NOT an identity, and Ramp mutates it.** It stores
  `"PO000002"` as `"2"` and suffixes a number with no numeric tail
  (`"CARBONPROBE-ZZZ"` → `"CARBONPROBE-ZZZ-1"`), both verified live 2026-09-26.
  `external_id` (the Carbon purchase-order id) is the identity, and
  `findPurchaseOrderByExternalId` is how a purchase order Carbon already pushed is
  recognised before creating a duplicate — without it a lost mapping made the
  document PERMANENTLY unsyncable (`400 DEVELOPER_7063` on every retry, forever).
  The `?external_id=` filter is honoured; an unsupported parameter on this endpoint
  is IGNORED and returns the full first page, which is how the filter was confirmed.
  The normalization is: a bare `<alpha-prefix><digits>` is reduced to the digits
  (`PO-000004` too — a separator does not help), while anything with content AFTER
  the digits is kept whole (`PO000004-1` verbatim, `PO000004-A` → `PO000004-A-1`).
  Omitting the field lets Ramp assign from its own sequence. Uniqueness is on the
  normalized value, and **archived purchase orders release their number**.
  Because of that normalization a bare Carbon readable id collides with purchase
  orders already in the customer's Ramp account (`PO000004` → `4`) and is refused on
  a FIRST push, permanently. `toRampPurchaseOrderNumber` therefore appends `-1`
  unconditionally — `PO000004-1` is stored verbatim and cannot collide, since its
  uniqueness follows from the Carbon id's. Unconditional rather than a retry, so the
  number a customer sees never depends on what else is in their Ramp account.
  Caveats: the transform could not be reduced to a rule (`PO-2026-003` → `2026-3`
  but `PO000004-1` untouched), so this is verified for the DEFAULT `PO`+6-digit
  sequence and not guaranteed for a customized one; and purchase orders pushed
  before the fix keep their reduced number, because PATCH does not resend it.
- **`vendor_id` is CREATE-only.** A PATCH carrying it is rejected whole with
  `422 DEVELOPER_7001 {"vendor_id": ["Unknown field."]}`, so the line items in the
  same request never land. PATCH sends `line_items` only.
- **A Completed purchase order is NOT archived — only a Closed one is.** Archiving is
  destructive (`GET` 404s, it leaves every list) and Ramp offers no non-destructive
  alternative: a purchase order carries `archived_at` and no state/closed field. A bill
  can only be matched to an order that still EXISTS, so archiving on `Completed`
  destroyed the counterpart at the exact moment its bill arrived, and "Matching Purchase
  Order" in Ramp could never populate. `Completed` = received AND invoiced, which is when
  the match matters; `Closed` = short-closed, no bill is coming. Pinned by
  `spend/gates.test.ts`. The cost of keeping them is that Ramp's purchase-order list
  grows — Ramp tracks `billing_status` / `receipt_status` per order, so a kept order does
  not read as "open", it is only one more row.
- **The bill↔order match: what is actually true.** Two earlier claims in this rule were
  DISPROVEN and have been removed — do not reinstate them.
  - **A draft bill DOES take a writable purchase-order link.** `purchase_order_ids` (an
    array of Ramp PO uuids, "Unique identifiers of the purchase orders to match this bill
    to") is documented and writable on BOTH `POST /developer/v1/bills/drafts` and
    `PATCH /developer/v1/bills/drafts/{id}`, as are
    `line_items[].purchase_order_line_item_id` and
    `inventory_line_items[].purchase_order_line_item_id`. Carbon does not send any of them
    yet — that is a **follow-up**, not a limitation.
  - The probe that reported the field absent tested nothing. `purchase_order_id`
    SINGULAR is not a field on that endpoint at all — an unknown key, silently ignored —
    so half the test was a no-op; and `GET /developer/v1/bills/drafts/{id}` (and the list
    endpoint) expose NO purchase-order key, so reading a draft back could never detect
    storage either way. It was a false negative. Those fields are readable only on a
    SUBMITTED bill: `GET /bills/{id}` returns `purchase_order_id` and
    `line_items[].purchase_order_line_item_id`.
  - **"Ramp performs the match itself" is unsupported.** Live sandbox state: PO000101
    (`archived_at: null`, `billing_status: OPEN`, `bill_ids: []`) and its draft bill
    AP000009 carried the same vendor and the same total, and Ramp had NOT matched them.
  The conclusion above is unchanged — a Completed order must not be archived, because the
  order existing is a prerequisite for ANY match — but it rests on that, not on automatic
  matching. `buildBillMemo`'s `"<invoice> · <orders>"` is a HUMAN trace, not the link.
- **A mapped purchase order Ramp no longer has recovers by recreating.** Every install
  that ran the archive-on-Completed build has mappings pointing at archived orders, and
  `PATCH` answers `404 DEVELOPER_7002` — without recovery the first push after the change
  would fail permanently on a mapping nothing repairs. `upsertRemote` catches exactly a
  404 and falls through to create, returning a new id (which rewrites the mapping). Safe
  only because **archiving releases the purchase-order number**: re-creating `PO000018-1`
  while the archived original still held it returned `201`, not `400 DEVELOPER_7063`
  (verified live 2026-09-27, and end-to-end through the real drain on PO000018).
- **POs** (`RampPurchaseOrderSyncer`, `ramp/entities/purchase-order.ts`): Closed mapped POs are archived; released POs
  ensure a Ramp vendor then create (carrying `external_id: po.id` for Ramp's
  bill-matching plus an entity-scoped idempotency key) or PATCH a mapped PO. Each local page
  preloads PO/vendor mappings in two reads and, only when named suppliers remain unmapped,
  drains one paginated Ramp vendor snapshot. Successful creates update that page cache, so
  shared suppliers never repeat mapping or provider lookups inside the PO loop.
- **Invoices** (`RampBillSyncer`, `ramp/entities/bill.ts`): **DRAFT-ONLY, shipped + live-verified 2026-09-11**
  (the `RAMP_DRAFT_BILL_CONTRACT_VERIFIED` gate is gone). Targets unmapped Open/Partially
  Paid invoices from non-Employee suppliers — `shouldSync` refuses an already-mapped bill
  BEFORE `mapToRemote` runs, so an `updatedAt` bump on a handed-off bill never re-resolves
  the vendor or replays the journal. Ensures the Ramp SPEND vendor, reads the
  invoice's POSTED "Purchase Invoice" journal for its account-costed lines via
  `loadBillPushLines` (`spend/bill-source.ts`, wrapping
  `loadBillCostingLines` + `toTransactionCurrencyLines` — the SAME path QBO/Xero/Rillet use —
  NOT `purchaseInvoiceLine.accountId`, which is null for item/part lines since posting
  resolves the real inventory / GR-IR / variance / tax accounts), then `POST /bills/drafts`
  with `remote_id: invoice.id` (the echo guard + bill-match key — the inbound `ramp-bills`
  step dedupes on it; do NOT also send `enable_accounting_sync: false`, which Ramp 422s
  against a remote_id), decimal document-currency line `amount`s, and per-line coding via
  `buildLineCodingSelections` (`lib/coding.ts`): GL account on Ramp's native `"Category"`
  field (`field_option_external_id` = the costing line's `account.id`), cost center on the
  custom `"carbon-cost-center"` field (option = the journal-line dimension `valueId` that is
  a `costCenter.id`). Only accounts/cost centers Carbon has pushed (present in
  `externalIntegrationMapping` entityType `account`/`costCenter`) are coded; an unpushed one
  degrades the line to uncoded rather than 422-ing the whole bill. An invoice with no posted
  journal (accounting disabled at post time) fails with `UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS` and retains its
  cursor.
  Maps `("bill", invoice.id, "ramp", <draft id>)`. It **NEVER submits** — Carbon hands off a
  provisional bill the customer completes/approves/pays in Ramp, because
  `POST /bills/drafts/{id}/submit` needs payment method + payee contact (per-vendor Ramp
  bill-pay config Carbon doesn't own; verified `400 BILL_PAY_7145`). PDF attach
  (`POST /bills/drafts/{id}/attachments`) is a deferred follow-up, NOT a create-body field.
- **Coding uses the SEAT-HOLDER's identifiers.** `field_option_external_id` is the
  Carbon `account.id` only while Carbon holds Ramp's accounting seat and published
  the options itself. When another system holds it, Ramp's options are THAT
  system's — verified live 2026-09-26 with Rillet connected, where ZERO of Ramp's
  147 GL options were keyed by a Carbon `acct_` id (Ramp exposes only the current
  connection's accounts). `RampProvider.codingIdentityIntegrationId`, set from the
  topology's `identityScope` in `resolveSyncProvider`, tells the bill syncer which
  integration's mappings to read and to emit their `externalId`; `SpendPushedCoding`
  is a `Carbon id -> wire id` MAP for this reason, not a membership set. A draft
  pushed this way reads back with `provider_name: "RILLET"`.
  `GET /developer/v1/bills/drafts/{id}` DOES exist and returns the stored coding,
  which is how this was confirmed.
- **The vendor is the seat-holder's too.** A bill's "Accounting Merchant" comes from
  the Ramp vendor's `accounting_vendor_remote_id`, and a vendor Carbon creates or
  matches has none — so in push-only every bill arrived with it empty even though the
  lines were coded. `decideRampSpendVendor` (`lib/spend.ts`, pure, tested) reads the
  seat-holder's vendor mapping (`rillet` / `vendor`) and: adopts the Ramp vendor that
  accounting vendor is ALREADY linked to (Ramp allows one); else links the mapped /
  matched / newly created vendor with `PATCH /vendors/{id}`. The link is a separate,
  best-effort call — never in the create body — so a refused link cannot fail the bill.
  A vendor a human linked to a DIFFERENT accounting vendor is left alone. The link is
  recorded on the `ramp` vendor mapping's `metadata.accountingVendorRemoteId`, so a
  linked supplier costs no Ramp call afterwards. <!-- UNVERIFIED: not yet live-tested
  that Ramp's accounting-vendor remote id equals the Rillet vendor id Carbon stores
  (the account ids do match — see above). -->
- **A delegated family's OWNER keeps its own entities.** `applyLedgerDelegation`
  takes the `integrationId` whose config is being resolved; without it, resolving
  Ramp's config disabled Ramp's `bill` entity (Ramp owns `ap` in push-only), so the
  spend platform never received the documents the delegation routes to it.
- **No bill archive-on-settlement**: a Ramp draft has no delete endpoint
  (`DELETE /bills/drafts/{id}` → 405; `DELETE /bills/{id}` on a draft id → 404), so a
  handed-off draft is not retracted when its Carbon invoice settles — Ramp owns the bill's
  lifecycle after handoff. (PO archive is separate and now runs on `Closed` only — above.)
- **A draft bill cannot be pushed twice.** A second create with the same `remote_id` is
  refused `409 DEVELOPER_7153 "A draft bill with this remote ID already exists for this
  accounting connection"` (verified live 2026-09-27). Duplicates are therefore impossible
  even with the mapping lost — but so is re-sending a corrected payload, which is what
  makes the create-once path the only shot at getting a draft right. **Never delete a
  bill mapping to force a re-push**: the draft survives, the create 409s, and the invoice
  is left permanently unsyncable with nothing pointing at its draft.
- **`memo` carries the Carbon numbers, because nothing else can.** `invoice_number` is
  the SUPPLIER's reference whenever there is one — that is what an AP clerk matches
  against the paper — so a bill in Ramp showed only `CEX-Q-4471` with no way back to
  `AP000008`. `buildBillMemo` (`ramp/entities/bill.ts`) writes `"<invoice> · <orders>"`
  (`AP000004 · PO000011`, verified stored live 2026-09-27), bare ids so a Ramp search for
  either finds the bill. The orders come from `SpendBillSource.purchaseOrderReadableIds`,
  loaded from `purchaseInvoiceLine.purchaseOrderId` — the link is per LINE, so a
  consolidated invoice names every order it settles. It is a HUMAN trace, NOT the machine
  link: `purchase_order_ids` and the per-line `purchase_order_line_item_id` are writable
  on a draft and are a follow-up Carbon has not wired up (see the bill↔order bullet
  above).

If any family leaves failures, a final `ramp-notify-failures` step sends one in-app
`NotificationEvent.IntegrationSync` to the integration's configurer (`updatedBy`, unless
`"system"`).

## The sweep (`ramp-sweep.ts`)

`rampSweepFunction` (id `ramp-sweep`, cron `0 * * * *` hourly, `retries: 2`): lists every
company with an ACTIVE `ramp` integration and fires one `carbon/ramp-sync`
(`reason: "sweep"`) each. **Webhooks are latency; the sweep is correctness** — a missed or
disabled webhook delivery becomes ≤1h of staleness, never permanent loss. `ramp-sync` is
idempotent, so re-firing is safe.

## Sync Activity (failure observability)

Every family records a **`Warning`** row on the shared `accountingSyncOperation` ledger
for each failed/skipped item, and clears it when that item later syncs — so a coded-but-
unrecognized charge shows up in the integration's **Sync Activity** tab with its reason
instead of vanishing into the Inngest logs. A successfully-synced item is NOT recorded (it
already appears as a `charge`/`purchaseInvoice`/`payment` row); the tab is a
"what didn't come through, and why" inbox, not a full audit log.

- `recordRampSyncFailures(ctx, {entityType, direction, failures})` and
  `resolveRampSyncOperations(ctx, {entityType, direction, entityIds})`
  (`ramp-sync-shared.ts`) are the two write points, called once per family after its
  drain. Both are **strictly best-effort** — every error (thrown OR returned) is swallowed
  and logged; observability must never fail or pollute a family's sync result. `ctx` gained
  `createdBy` (`integration.updatedBy ?? "system"`) and `trigger` (`webhook` vs `event`).
- entityType/direction per family: card charges `charge`, transfers `transfer`,
  cashbacks `cashback`, bills `bill`, bill payments `billPayment`, reimbursements
  `reimbursement`, repayments `repayment` — all `pull-from-accounting`; PO push
  `purchaseOrder` and draft-bill push `purchaseInvoice` — `push-to-accounting`. entityId is
  the Ramp id inbound, the Carbon record id outbound (direction disambiguates the tuple).
- Records are `Warning` because a Ramp failure is a config hole (`Warning` is what the tab's
  `failingCount` badge counts) via the ee `insertTerminalSyncOperation`. Unlike accounting
  journals — whose disposition is permanent — a Ramp inbound family RE-EVALUATES every run, so
  the resolve-on-success delete (`clearResolvedSyncOperations`, ee `operations.ts`) is what
  drops a recoded-and-posted charge out of the inbox. `mapped`/already-synced items also
  resolve, so a fixed item that is now skipped-as-mapped still clears its old Warning.
- The **Sync Activity tab renders for Ramp** (`producesSyncOperations` in the ERP
  `integrations.$id.tsx` loader — accounting category OR Ramp), with the accounting-only
  tie-out/reconciliation surfaces kept gated on `isAccountingInstalled`. Retention/compaction
  needs nothing new — Ramp rows live in the same `accountingSyncOperation` table the nightly
  passes already sweep.

## Charge schema (migration `20260919152233_ramp-integration.sql`)

The forward, retry-safe reconciliation migration supersedes the three branch-only Ramp
schema migrations. Both `charge` and `chargeLine` use composite
`(id, companyId)` primary keys with `id()` defaults. The parent, supplier, and cost-center
relationships are tenant-composite; account triggers require header and line accounts to
belong to the company's `companyGroupId`. It also converges the Ramp registry row, journal
enum values, document enums, indexes, RLS, event trigger, and the per-company
`CHG-%{yyyy}-%{mm}-` sequence.

- `charge`: `chargeId` (readable, unique per company), `type`, `status`,
  `integration` (default `'ramp'`), `cardAccountId` (NOT NULL FK `account`), `offsetAccountId`
  (nullable FK), merchant/holder/last4/memo, `transactionDate`/`postingDate` (DATE),
  `currencyCode`, `exchangeRate`, `amount` (`>= 0`), `journalId`, posted/voided audit.
  CHECK: Payment/Cashback/Repayment require an `offsetAccountId`; Charge/Credit use lines.
- `chargeLine`: codes an `amount` to an `accountId` (+ optional tenant-composite
  `costCenterId`), `sequence`, and a same-company parent with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- RLS on both is gated by **invoicing** permissions. The lifecycle trigger allows only
  Draft edits, Draft→Posted bookkeeping fields, and Posted→Voided audit fields. The line
  trigger locks the same parent row as posting and refuses mutation unless it is Draft, so
  line edits and post/void serialize rather than race. Migration
  `20260919152233_ramp-integration.sql` adds the stored state
  invariant: Draft requires the journal and all posting/void audit fields to be null;
  Posted requires `postingDate`, `postedAt`, and `postedBy` with void audit fields null;
  Voided requires both posting and void audit fields. `journalId` remains optional for
  Posted/Voided because accounting-disabled companies do not create a journal.

## Charges → the accounting provider

The forward reconciliation migration gives `charge` a tenant-composite
**`supplierId`** foreign key and an **event trigger**
(`attach_event_trigger('charge', …)`). The card
family resolves the Ramp merchant to a Carbon supplier before posting —
`resolveMerchantSupplier` (`lib/suppliers.ts`) is **match-or-default, never one
supplier per merchant** (that polluted the vendor master with hundreds of one-off
rows; see `.ai/specs/2026-09-19-ramp-integration.md`): mapping-first
under entityType `"merchant"` keyed by Ramp `merchant_id`, then an exact-name match
to an EXISTING supplier (a merchant that is already a real vendor — links it and
writes the mapping), then the single `"Card Merchant"` house supplier per company
(`resolveCardMerchantCatchAllSupplier`, tagged the `"Card Merchant"` supplierType,
find-or-create — NO per-merchant mapping written on this fallback). It no longer
delegates to `resolveRampSupplier` (that stays the bill/PO `"vendor"` path and keeps
its auto-create). A transaction with no merchant name still posts with `supplierId`
null. Because all card spend now shares the catch-all vendor, merchant identity
rides on the provider charge **line description**
(`charge.merchantName ?? line.description ?? charge.memo`), not on `vendor_id` alone. A Posted `Charge` (and, where
the provider can represent a refund, `Credit`) with a supplier is then pushed to the
accounting provider as its native **card-charge object** (Rillet charge, QBO Purchase,
Xero SPEND bank transaction) with the merchant and cost-center dimension, and its journal
is DOC_BACKED-excluded per row; everything else stays a journal entry. Ramp receipts remain
attached to the Carbon transaction; only the Rillet adapter currently uploads them to the
provider. Full
rules: `.claude/rules/accounting-sync-handlers.md` → "Card charges as provider objects".

## post-charge edge function

`packages/database/supabase/functions/post-charge/` (registered in
`config.toml`, `verify_jwt = true`). `{ type: "post" | "void", chargeId, userId,
companyId }`. `postChargeTransaction` opens one Kysely transaction and performs
the tenant-scoped header `FOR UPDATE` as its first read; every settings, company, line,
account, period, journal, dimension, and lifecycle write stays inside that transaction.
Repeated post of Posted or void of Voided returns the stored journal id without another
journal. The database parent-locking line trigger takes the same lock, closing the line-edit
race.

The handler requires invoicing-update permission. For an authenticated JWT, the shared
edge permission helper requires its `sub` to equal the requested `userId` and looks up
permissions for that subject; a body-supplied privileged user cannot substitute for it.

- **post**: only from Draft. Requires company settings/config, active non-group posting
  accounts in the company group, a Liability card account, Asset payment offset, Revenue
  cashback offset, and company-scoped cost centers. Resolves the accounting period (shifts a Locked/Closed period
  forward to the next open period, writing the shifted `postingDate` back). When
  `companySettings.accountingEnabled`, builds the journal (`sourceType`/`documentType`
  `'Charge'`) and writes cost-center `journalLineDimension`s against the
  group's oldest active `CostCenter` `dimension` row; flips the row to Posted with
  `journalId`. Accounting-off = Posted with no journal. **A line carrying a
  `costCenterId` with no such dimension row REFUSES to post** ("Company group has no
  active Cost Center dimension") rather than posting a balanced journal that silently
  lost the tag — `pushCostCenters` creates the row for installed integrations, so this
  only fires for a company posting charges without the Ramp converge.
  Payment/Cashback reject any coding lines; Charge/Credit/Repayment require finite,
  strictly positive line magnitudes summing to the header. Journal line ids are allocated
  before insertion and bound explicitly to dimensions, never inferred from RETURNING order.
- **void**: only from Posted. When a journal exists, requires accounting enabled and proves
  the original company-scoped journal is Posted, source type `Charge`, and every
  line points back to this document. It writes a new Posted reversal with negated amounts
  and copied dimensions, then flips the document to Voided. Documents posted while
  accounting was disabled have no journal and void without fabricating one.
  Reversal line ids are also allocated before insertion, preserving each original line's
  dimension identity even if a database returns inserted rows in another order.

### The journal builder (`build-charge-journal.ts`)

Pure, unit-testable, golden-master-pinned. Amounts are **natural-balance-signed** via
`credit()`/`debit()` (a balanced entry has debits == credits and does NOT sum to zero in
stored `amount`; a separate debit(+)/credit(−) total is asserted ~0 within
`BALANCE_TOLERANCE = 0.01`). Both sides divide by the foreign-per-base `exchangeRate` to
base currency. The card
account is **always booked as a LIABILITY** (a credit card is money owed). The five types:

| Type | Journal |
|------|---------|
| **Charge** | line accounts **debited** (their class); card liability **credited** for the total. Requires lines summing to the header. |
| **Credit** | mirror of Charge — line accounts credited; card liability debited (refund/return). |
| **Payment** | card liability **debited**; the offset (bank asset) **credited** — statement payment pays down the card. |
| **Cashback** | card liability **debited**; the offset **credited as REVENUE** (a rebate is income), whatever the offset's class. |
| **Repayment** | offset (bank asset or card liability, per funding) **debited** for the total; each line account **credited**. Requires lines summing to the header. |

## ERP UI (invoicing module)

- Routes: `charges.tsx` (list, loader `getCharges`, filters
  search/type/status), `charges.$id.tsx` (read-only Drawer detail with lines +
  receipts + a **Void** action for Posted rows, `update: "invoicing"`),
  `charges.$id.void.tsx` (action → service-role `functions.invoke(
  "post-charge", { type: "void" })`).
- Components: `apps/erp/app/modules/invoicing/ui/Charge/` —
  `ChargesTable.tsx`, `ChargeStatus.tsx`, `index.ts`. Service:
  `getCharge(client, companyId, id)` / `getCharges` in
  `invoicing.service.ts`. Detail, line, document, and cost-center reads are company-scoped;
  account labels are resolved only from the authenticated company's group.

## The webhook route

`apps/erp/app/routes/api+/webhook.ramp.$companyId.ts` (`runtime: "nodejs"` for the
constant-time HMAC) is what Ramp POSTs to. A delivery is a **nudge, not data**: after
verification it fires the same `trigger("ramp-sync", { reason: "webhook" })` the sweep
fires, so the sync body re-derives everything and a lost delivery is only latency. Flow:
`getRampIntegration` (404 when not installed/active; resolves the vaulted `webhookSecret`)
→ **signature verify** (`x-ramp-signature` header + `verifyRampWebhookSignature`,
fail-closed 401 without a stored secret or valid signature) → **challenge handshake**
(only a `challenge` in the signed body calls `completeWebhookVerification` and echoes
`{ challenge }`; an unsigned query parameter cannot supply or override it) → otherwise
parse `RampWebhookEventSchema` (unrecognized events acked, never rejected) →
`trigger("ramp-sync")`. The exact Ramp header name, signing encoding, and challenge shape
remain sandbox-unverified defaults; unsigned handshakes are rejected. The **hourly
`ramp-sweep` remains the
correctness guarantee**; the webhook is latency only.

## Caveats & not-yet-built

- **One active connection per company.** The metadata carries a single `connectionId` /
  `webhookId`; `ensureRampConnection` creates one connection (`remote_provider_name:
  "Carbon"`) and reuses it — there is no multi-connection support.
- **Sandbox** = `demo-api.ramp.com` (`RAMP_SANDBOX_HOST`) for a stored legacy
  `client_credentials` record. The current Connect UI creates production OAuth records and
  exposes no environment selector.
- **API uncertainties remain source-marked**: the draft-bill payload/submit identity,
  repayment funding beyond documented `ach`, all-connections/accounts endpoints, and the
  webhook challenge/signing contract. Bill payment methods and reimbursement states use
  explicit supported sets checked against Ramp's 2026-09-11 OpenAPI contract; other values
  fail closed. Transaction amount/coding behavior and converted PO-line reconciliation are
  implemented. Grep `TODO(task-1)` in `packages/ee/src/ramp/**` and
  `packages/jobs/src/inngest/functions/integrations/ramp-sync*.ts` before relying on one
  of the remaining values.
- There is **no `apps/erp/app/modules/invoicing/AGENTS.md`** to cross-reference.
- **User-facing docs (`docs/`) are a separate follow-up** — not written here.
