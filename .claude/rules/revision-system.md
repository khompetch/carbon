# Revision System

Carbon lets multiple **revisions** of the same item (Part, Material, Tool,
Consumable, Service) coexist. A revision is just another `item` row sharing the
same `readableId` + `companyId` + `type`, distinguished by its `revision` string.
Introduced in `20250519122022_revisions.sql`; ordering/filtering refined through
`20260515120000_fix-item-details-revisions-filter-by-type.sql` (read the newest).

## Data model (verified)

- A revision **is** a full `item` row. There is no separate revision table. The
  type tables (`part`/`material`/`tool`/`consumable`/`service`) hold properties
  shared across revisions; the `item` row holds per-revision data.
- **Item linkage is positional**, not a FK: `part.id` (and `material.id`,
  `tool.id`, …) equals the item's **`readableId`**. The old `*.itemId` FK columns
  were dropped in `20250519122022`. Join via `item.readableId = <typeTable>.id AND item.companyId = <typeTable>.companyId`. So one type row ↔ many item revisions.
- `item.revision` TEXT DEFAULT `'0'` (the initial/unnamed revision). Named
  revisions are arbitrary strings (`A`, `B`, …).
- `item.readableIdWithRevision` is a **STORED generated column**:
  `readableId` when `revision` is `'0'`/empty, else `readableId || '.' || revision`
  (e.g. `P000123` → `P000123.A`). TS mirror: `getReadableIdWithRevision(readableId, revision?)`
  in `apps/erp/app/utils/string.ts`.
- Uniqueness: `item_unique UNIQUE ("readableId", "revision", "companyId", "type")`.
  The `type` in the key means a Part and a Consumable **can legally share a
  `readableId`** — which is why the detail RPCs must filter revisions by type
  (see Gotchas).

## Which revision is shown

There is **no `activeRevision` flag** on items. The list views (`parts`,
`materials`, `tools`, `consumables`, `services`) collapse to **one row per
`(readableId, companyId)`** via a `latest_items` CTE
(`DISTINCT ON ... ORDER BY`). Current ordering
(`20260325073453_fix-latest-revision-ordering.sql`) **prefers named revisions
over the `'0'`/empty initial revision**, then `createdAt DESC` as tiebreaker — so
the most-recent *named* revision is the default surfaced. Each view row also
carries a `revisions` JSON array (all siblings) for the version switcher.

Detail pages route by the specific item **`id` (UUID)**, so the URL pins the exact
revision. The `get_<type>_details(item_id)` RPCs return that revision's data plus
the type-scoped `revisions` array.

## Creating a revision

- Validator: `revisionValidator` in `apps/erp/app/modules/items/items.models.ts`
  — `{ id?, type, copyFromId?, revision }`; requires `id` **or** `copyFromId`.
- Route: `apps/erp/app/routes/x+/items+/revisions.new.tsx` (action). For a **new**
  revision it requires `copyFromId`, loads that item via `getItem`, then calls
  `createRevision(getCarbonServiceRole(), getDatabaseClient(), { item, revision, createdBy })`.
  Redirects to the new revision's detail page by type. URL: `path.to.newRevision`.
- Service: `createRevision(client, db, args)` (`items.service.ts`). In ONE Kysely
  transaction it inserts a new `item` row copying the source's core fields (same
  `readableId`, new `revision`, `active: true`) and copies the source's planning
  and purchasing setup onto it (next bullet), so a revision with default planning
  and no suppliers is never visible and a failure leaves no row holding the
  revision label. After the commit, if `replenishmentSystem !== "Buy"`, it calls
  the `get-method` server function (`@carbon/server-functions/get-method`,
  `type: "itemToItem"`) to copy the method/BOM from source to the new revision.
  That call runs its own transaction, so it cannot join this one: a failure is
  logged and the revision stands (the method can be copied again). Three callers, one behaviour: the New Revision
  route, material sizes (`upsertMaterial`), and a change notice's Revision draft
  (`createChangeNoticeDraftMethod`, `active: false`).
- **Authorization.** Kysely bypasses RLS, so before the transaction
  `createRevision` calls `assert_company_access(companyId, 'parts_create')`
  through the caller's `client` (`requireCompanyPermission`, shared with the
  delete paths below) — the same predicate as the `item` INSERT policy
  (`inCompany("companyId", "parts_create")`), and a no-op for a service-role
  client. It matters: two change-notice routes (`$id.affected`,
  `…change-type`) only require `parts_update`, so without the gate a user who
  cannot create parts could mint a revision there. A refused caller gets the
  function's error and nothing is written. A taken revision label comes back as
  `{ code: "23505" }`.
- **What a revision inherits** (`copyItemPlanningAndPurchasing(trx, …)`, inside
  that transaction, every statement scoped to the company on both sides). The
  item interceptor runs with the insert, so the new item's `itemReplenishment` /
  `itemPlanning` / `itemCost` rows already exist with defaults and are updated
  in place:
  - `itemReplenishment`: `lotSize` (Batch Size), `scrapPercentage`, `leadTime`,
    `preferredSupplierId`, and with it `purchasingUnitOfMeasureCode` +
    `conversionFactor` (both derived from the preferred supplier's supplier part).
  - `itemPlanning`, per location: `reorderingPolicy` and its sizing parameters
    (accumulation period, safety stock, reorder point and quantity, maximum
    inventory, min/max order quantity, order multiple). A policy without its
    parameters is invalid, so they travel together. The two other fields on the
    planning form, `planningHorizonDays` and `responsibleEmployee`, are NOT
    copied (`copyItemPlanningAndPurchasing`, `items.service.ts`).
  - `itemCost.itemPostingGroupId` (the item group).
  - `supplierPart` rows and their `supplierPartPrice` price breaks, paired by
    `supplierId` (unique per item).
  NOT copied: costs, `itemUnitSalePrice`, `requiresConfiguration` and the
  blocked flags, `minimumReserveQuantity`, supersession, pick method, shelf life,
  `itemPlanning.planningHorizonDays`, `itemPlanning.responsibleEmployee`.
- **Deleting an item deletes its price breaks first.** `supplierPart.itemId`
  cascades from `item`, but `supplierPartPrice → supplierPart` is
  `ON DELETE RESTRICT`, and every revision of an item with price breaks now
  carries them. `deleteItemsWithPriceBreaks(trx, { itemIds, companyId })` deletes
  the price breaks and then the items, scoped to the company, inside the
  caller's Kysely transaction — so an item delete Postgres refuses (ledger
  history, tracked entities) leaves the price breaks in place. Two callers, both
  gated by `assert_company_access(companyId, 'parts_delete')` (the `item` /
  `makeMethod` DELETE rule):
  - `deleteItem(client, db, id, companyId)` — the Item Master delete. A refusal
    keeps its SQLSTATE (`23503`), which the route maps to its message.
  - `discardChangeNoticeDrafts(client, db, drafts, companyId)` — every draft of
    the call (draft items, and Version draft methods) in ONE transaction, and it
    returns the error. `removeChangeNoticeAffectedItem` and `deleteChangeNotice`
    stop on it, so the affected row / notice is never removed while its draft
    survives; `updateChangeNoticeAffectedItemChangeType` checks `parts_delete`
    before it creates the replacement draft, and reports a late failure.
  Deleting a single **supplier part** that has price breaks
  (`deleteSupplierPart`) is still refused by the same constraint.
- UI form: `RevisionForm.tsx`; version switcher menus ("Versions" submenu) live in
  the type tables (`PartsTable.tsx`, etc.), shown only when `revisions.length > 1`,
  linking each sibling by its item id. Badge component: `ItemWithRevision.tsx`.

## Make methods vs. revisions (distinct concepts)

A **make method** is the manufacturing recipe for a Part/Tool item; a `makeMethod`
row is auto-created per item via the `create_make_method_related_records` AFTER
INSERT trigger (so **each revision gets its own makeMethod**).

Make methods are independently **versioned** (`20250603011801_make-method-version.sql`):
- `makeMethod.version` NUMERIC DEFAULT 1, `makeMethod.status` enum `makeMethodStatus`
  = `Draft | Active | Archived`. Unique `(itemId, version)`.
- View `activeMakeMethods` ranks per `itemId`, preferring `status='Active'` then
  `version DESC` (excludes `Archived`) — picks the one current method per item.
- `activateMethodVersion` (`items.service.ts`) calls the `convert` server function
  (`type: "methodVersionToActive"`). Route: `x+/items+/methods+/versions.activate.$id.tsx`.
- `jobMakeMethod.version` / `quoteMakeMethod.version` denormalize the method version
  at job/quote creation. Don't conflate method `version` (per-item recipe) with item
  `revision` (a sibling item row).

## Gotchas

- **Detail-RPC revisions are type-scoped.** `get_part_details` /
  `get_tool_details` / `get_material_details` / `get_consumable_details` filter the
  `item_revisions` CTE by `i."type" = '<Type>'`
  (`20260515120000_fix-item-details-revisions-filter-by-type.sql`). A pre-fix RPC
  leaked a Consumable into a Part's revisions list because they shared a `readableId`.
  Keep the type filter when editing these functions.
- **`'0'`/`''`/NULL are all the initial revision.** The view ordering and the
  generated column all special-case them together — handle all three.
- **No `itemId` FK on type tables**; join on `readableId` + `companyId`. Adding an
  `itemReadableId` column is explicitly disallowed by the DB conventions.
- The detail RPCs no longer select `i."requiresInspection"` — that column was dropped
  2026-07-26 and the RPCs recreated without it (older RPC bodies in migrations between
  `20260419094132` and the drop still select it; newest wins).
