# Database Migration Patterns

How migrations are written and structured in Carbon. The full workflow (checklist,
.models.ts updates) is in `workflow-database-migration.md` — follow that. The table
template lives in `conventions-database.md`. This file captures the **real conventions in
the SQL itself**, grounded in the newest migrations. Don't repeat those two files.

Migrations live in `packages/database/supabase/migrations/`, timestamp-prefixed
(`YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive-name.sql`), applied in order by the Supabase CLI. **Read the
NEWEST relevant migration for current truth — tables get renamed and functions get revised;
never trust the first match or this doc over the live SQL.**

## Commands (verified in root `package.json`)

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm db:migrate:new <name>` | Create a new migration file (`supabase migration new`). |
| `pnpm db:migrate` | Apply pending migrations to the local worktree DB (`crbn migrate`); also regenerates types + swagger unless `--no-regen`. |
| `pnpm db:types` | Regenerate generated DB types after migrations. |

There is **no `db:build` script** — older docs/cache referenced it; ignore that. Use
`pnpm db:migrate` to apply locally. Never rebuild the DB to test; let the user do it.

**Timestamp warning:** never use `000000` for the HHMMSS portion (e.g. `…000000_foo.sql`).
The timestamp is the migration's primary key; randomize HHMMSS (e.g. `20260619142853_…`) to
avoid cross-branch collisions.

## Table creation (canonical, from `20260609143732_document-template.sql`)

```sql
CREATE TABLE "documentTemplate" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT id(),
    "companyId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "documentType" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "blocks" JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '[]',

    "createdBy" TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES "user"("id"),
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    "updatedBy" TEXT REFERENCES "user"("id"),
    "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,

    PRIMARY KEY ("id", "companyId"),
    FOREIGN KEY ("companyId") REFERENCES "company"("id") ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE INDEX "documentTemplate_companyId_idx" ON "documentTemplate" ("companyId");
CREATE INDEX "documentTemplate_createdBy_idx" ON "documentTemplate" ("createdBy");

-- Named, company-scoped uniqueness via ALTER (not inline)
ALTER TABLE "documentTemplate" ADD CONSTRAINT "documentTemplate_companyId_documentType_key"
    UNIQUE ("companyId", "documentType");
```

- **`id()` default** — both bare `id()` and prefixed `id('prefix')` are current and common
  (prefixes are short: `id('pr')`, `id('dim')`, `id('je')`, `id('tce')`). Either is fine.
  Never use a raw UUID.
- **Composite PK `("id", "companyId")`** + `companyId` FK to `company` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`.
- **Audit columns** reference `user` **inline** (`TEXT NOT NULL REFERENCES "user"("id")`) — no
  separate named FK constraints.
- **MANDATORY: every table with `createdBy` MUST also have `updatedBy`** — a nullable
  `"updatedBy" TEXT REFERENCES "user"("id")`. The shared audit-injection path (MCP
  the Carbon API dispatch, service writes) stamps `updatedBy` on every write, so a table that has
  `createdBy` but omits `updatedBy` fails those callers with `column "updatedBy" does not exist`.
  Include it even on append-only ledger tables (it just stays NULL there). When authoring a
  migration that adds `createdBy`, add `updatedBy` in the same statement.
- **`updatedAt` is set by the app on write, not by a DB trigger.** Don't add a generic
  timestamp trigger.
- Index `companyId` and every FK (e.g. `createdBy`).
- Never add an `itemReadableId` column, and never specify decimal places in a `NUMERIC` — this applies everywhere: column definitions, `RETURNS TABLE` declarations, and `::NUMERIC` casts. Always use bare `NUMERIC`, never `NUMERIC(19,4)` or any precision form.

## RLS

Policies are **not** written in migrations. Add the table's rule to
`packages/database/src/authz/manifest.ts` — usually one line, `entityName: company("<module>")`,
which renders the four standard policies (`SELECT` any employee via
`get_companies_with_employee_role()`, writes via
`get_companies_with_employee_permission('<module>_<action>')`) — then `pnpm db:migrate` syncs it
locally and `pnpm --filter @carbon/database authz migration <name>` ships it to production.
Full guide, including tables without a `companyId`: `authz-manifest.md`.

Gate writes on the **write** permission, not just visibility — a SELECT-only predicate on
INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE is a privilege-escalation bug (`20260614092317_picking-tracked-entity-rls.sql`
exists because of one). `parent(table, fk, module)` gets this right for child tables.

## Views

Always `SECURITY_INVOKER=true` so the underlying tables' RLS applies to the querying user:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW "module_entityView" WITH(SECURITY_INVOKER=true) AS
SELECT e.*, u."fullName" AS "createdByFullName"
FROM "entityName" e
LEFT JOIN "user" u ON u."id" = e."createdBy";
```

`CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` replaces the view's options, so recreating a view without the `WITH`
clause silently turns it back into an owner-rights view that bypasses RLS for every PostgREST
caller, anon included (`openJobMaterialLines`, fixed in `20260926093417`). The
`no-view-without-invoker` check (`@carbon/checks`) fails any `CREATE VIEW` that does not state
`security_invoker`; the `view-without-security-invoker` invariant checks the live catalog.
Materialized views cannot run as the caller — revoke SELECT from `anon, authenticated` instead.

## Triggers

There is **no generic boilerplate trigger** to add per table. Triggers in this codebase are
purpose-built (status recomputation, search-index sync, the event-system dispatch) and live
in their own migrations — e.g. `CREATE TRIGGER update_picking_list_status_trigger …`
(`20260601143527_picking-lists.sql`). Don't manufacture an `updatedAt`/`companyId` trigger;
add a trigger only when there's real derived state to maintain. For async/event-driven side
effects use the event system (see `event-system.md`), not ad-hoc triggers.
<!-- UNVERIFIED: no GRANT statements appear in recent migrations; per-table grants are not a current convention -->

## Restricting a function: guard inside, never `REVOKE EXECUTE`

Every function in `public` is a PostgREST RPC. On supabase/postgres 15.14.1.112, calling a function
the caller lacks EXECUTE on, as `anon`/`authenticated`, **segfaults the backend** and restarts every
connection. So a `REVOKE EXECUTE … FROM anon, authenticated` turns "not allowed" into an
unauthenticated one-request DoS. (A missing TABLE privilege is an ordinary error; table REVOKEs are fine.)

- **Service-role-only function called directly by a service client** — first statement of the body:
  `IF current_setting('role', true) IN ('anon','authenticated') THEN RAISE EXCEPTION … USING ERRCODE = 'insufficient_privilege'; END IF;`
  PostgREST's `SET ROLE` stays visible inside SECURITY DEFINER, and service role / direct connections
  (`none`) pass. Examples: `get_integration_secret`, `assert_audit_log_access(company, NULL)`.
- **Tenant-scoped function** (SECURITY DEFINER, takes a company id from the caller) — first
  statement `PERFORM assert_company_access(company_id[, '<module>_<action>'])` (in a
  `LANGUAGE sql` body: a leading `SELECT assert_company_access(company_id);`). It raises; never
  write the check inline as `IF NOT (x = ANY(helper()) OR …)`: when a lookup finds nothing that
  expression is NULL, `IF NOT NULL` does not raise, and the guard fails open. That is how
  `get_next_sequence` and the storage-requirement RPCs let any caller through until
  `20260925121735`. A user id from the caller needs the same care (`get_claims`,
  `groups_for_user`).
- **Internal helper of a SECURITY DEFINER function** — the role GUC still says `authenticated` inside
  the nested call, so the guard above would refuse legitimate callers. Make the helper
  `SECURITY INVOKER`: from its SECURITY DEFINER caller it runs as the owner, and from the API it runs
  under the caller's RLS (`terminal_job_operations`, `complete_job_remaining_quantities`). Or put it in
  `util` (no API `USAGE`) — see `event-system.md`.

- **Event interceptor** — SECURITY INVOKER. The dispatchers are SECURITY DEFINER, so it runs as
  the owner on every write; called directly it runs under the caller's RLS (`event-system.md`).

Every public table has RLS (including the per-company `searchIndex_*` / `auditLog_*` tables), so a
SECURITY INVOKER function can do nothing through the API that REST could not. Default to it; reach
for SECURITY DEFINER only when the function must see across RLS, and then guard it as above. The
`public-definer-function-authorizes-caller` invariant (`pnpm --filter @carbon/checks invariants`)
fails on any SECURITY DEFINER function with no recognized guard.

Migration `20260924192316_api-function-guards-not-revokes.sql` converted the six functions that used
REVOKE; `20260925121735_rpc-function-guards.sql` closed the other 98. Test a new guard in a
throwaway container (`docker run --rm supabase/postgres:<tag>`), never a shared database — and call
the function as `anon`, don't just check `has_function_privilege`: the segfault only shows on the
call. `packages/database/supabase/tests/rpc-privileges.test.sql` is the tenant-isolation test.

## Enums

```sql
CREATE TYPE "warehouseTransferStatus" AS ENUM ('Draft', 'To Ship', 'To Receive', 'Completed');
```

Add new values with `ALTER TYPE "<enum>" ADD VALUE '<v>'` in a later migration (cannot run
inside a transaction block with other statements that use the value).

## Gotchas

- Read the **newest** migration touching a table/function — renames (`shelf`→`storageUnit`,
  `customRule`→`storageRule`→`enforcementRule`) and revised RPCs are common.
- Schema-qualify (`"public"."t"`) on RLS statements; cast helper results `::text[]`.
- After adding a migration, regenerate types (`pnpm db:types`) or typecheck breaks with
  `SelectQueryError` / "excessively deep" errors.
- For DB **access** patterns (clients, services, Kysely transactions) see
  `database-patterns.md`; for the table template + checklist see `conventions-database.md`.
