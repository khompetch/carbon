# Quote Discount & Pricing System

Discounts live on **quote line prices** (per quantity break), and there is also a
standalone, company-scoped **pricing rule** engine (Discount/Markup) that drives the
*base unit price* during cost rollup. The two are distinct — see "Two layers" below.

## Schema: `quoteLinePrice`

PK is **`(quoteLineId, quantity)`** — there is no `id` column (the original `id` PK
was dropped in `20240802114117_quote-line-quantities.sql`, which also dropped the
original `unitCost`/`markupPercent`/`extendedPrice` columns and added `unitPrice`).
Current columns (after later migrations):

- `quoteId`, `quoteLineId`, `quantity` NUMERIC, `unitPrice` NUMERIC
- `discountPercent` NUMERIC(10,5) DEFAULT 0 — stored as a **fraction 0..1** (e.g. 0.10 = 10%), NOT a whole number
- `leadTime` NUMERIC, `shippingCost` NUMERIC (`20241105002325_quote-taxes-and-shipping.sql`)
- `exchangeRate` NUMERIC DEFAULT 1 (`20241010193506_quote-order-presentation-currency.sql`)
- `categoryMarkups` JSONB DEFAULT `'{}'` (`20260307000000_quote-line-category-markups.sql`) — per-cost-category markup % keyed by `costCategoryKeys`, stored as whole percent (e.g. 25 = 25%)
- **Generated (STORED) columns** from `20241010193506`:
  - `netUnitPrice` = `unitPrice * (1 - discountPercent)`
  - `convertedUnitPrice` = `unitPrice * exchangeRate`
  - `convertedNetUnitPrice` = `unitPrice * exchangeRate * (1 - discountPercent)`
  - `netExtendedPrice` = `unitPrice * (1 - discountPercent) * quantity`
  - `convertedNetExtendedPrice` = `unitPrice * exchangeRate * (1 - discountPercent) * quantity`
  - `convertedShippingCost` = `shippingCost * exchangeRate`

A trigger on `quote.exchangeRate` cascades the new rate into every `quoteLinePrice` row.

`quoteLine` itself has **no** `discountPercent`; it has `taxPercent`, `additionalCharges`
(JSONB), `quantity` (array of breaks), plus `pricingRuleId` and `priceTrace` JSONB
(`20260413120001_pricing-rules.sql`). `quote` has no discount field.

## Schema: `pricingRule` (`20260413120001_pricing-rules.sql`)

Standalone rules, `id` default `id('pr')`, scoped to a company. Columns: `name`,
`ruleType` (`pricingRuleType` enum = `'Discount' | 'Markup' | 'Configuration'`), `amountType`
(`pricingRuleAmountType` enum = `'Percentage' | 'Fixed'`, default `Percentage`),
`amount` NUMERIC, `priority` INT, `minQuantity`/`maxQuantity`, `customerIds[]`,
`customerTypeIds[]`, `itemIds[]`, `itemPostingGroupId`, `validFrom`/`validTo`,
`active` BOOLEAN. Same migration adds `salesOrderLine.pricingRuleId` + `priceTrace`.
<!-- UNVERIFIED: schema also declares `formulaBase` and `minMarginPercent` columns, but neither the validator (`pricingRuleValidator`) nor `applyPriceRules` reads them — appear unused -->

## Two layers, and how discount is applied

1. **Quote-line discount** (`quoteLinePrice.discountPercent`): a per-quantity-break
   percentage editors enter in `QuoteLinePricing.tsx`. Net price = `unitPrice * (1 - discount)`
   (also materialized in the generated `netUnitPrice` column). The UI computes the same
   net for display; persistence is the generated columns.

2. **Pricing-rule engine** (`resolvePrice` in `sales.service.ts` → `applyPriceRules` in `sales.utils.ts`):
   resolves a *base unit price* during quote-line price recalculation (cost rollup with
   `categoryMarkups`, then `resolvePrice`). Precedence: customer override > customer-type
   override > all-customers override > base (`itemUnitSalePrice`). Overrides may set
   `applyRulesOnTop=false` to skip the discount and markup rules. Then `applyPriceRules`:
   - **Discount rules: non-stacking** — highest `priority` wins; ties broken by best
     effective amount. Percentage = `price * amount`; Fixed = `amount`.
   - **Markup rules: stack** in priority order, compounding on the running price.
   - **Configuration rules** (`ruleType = 'Configuration'`, one configurable item, amount 0):
     their `configurationPrices` are signed per-unit surcharges added to the starting price
     BEFORE the discount, stacking across every matched Configuration rule; they need the
     line's `configuration` (`quoteLine` / `salesOrderLine`), passed to `resolvePrice` as
     `input.configuration`. Trace steps carry the parameter's `label`, saved on each
     price entry by the rule form (no lookup at pricing time). An override with
     `applyRulesOnTop=false` skips discounts and markups but still applies the
     configuration prices (`applyPriceRules(..., { configurationOnly: true })`).
   - Final price clamped to ≥ 0.
   Each step is recorded as a `PriceTraceStep` (`{ step, source, amount, adjustment?, ruleId? }`).
   The trace is a **snapshot stored with the price** — pricing rules are edited
   in place, so re-running today's rules cannot explain yesterday's price.
   - `quoteLinePrice.priceTrace` (migration `20261001125824`), one per quantity
     break. Written by every system-pricing path: the three
     `build*PriceRows` builders, `recalculateQuoteLinePrices`, the grid's
     Markup % (`recalculate-price` route, `priceTracesByQuantity`) and
     per-category markup edits, and `repriceQuoteLineFromRules`. A typed price
     (`priceSource = 'manual'`) writes `null`. `rewriteQuoteLinePrices` does
     NOT carry an omitted trace over (it explains the unit price, which every
     caller restates) — except the precision rebuild, which passes the stored
     one. Kysely writes `JSON.stringify` it (a JS array would go out as a
     Postgres array literal). `get-method` `quoteToQuote` copies it.
     `withBasePriceSource` renames the Base Price step's source
     (`QUOTE_BASE_PRICE_SOURCES`: "Cost + Markup", "Supplier Price"), since
     `resolvePrice` names every base the item's sale price.
   - `salesOrderLine.priceTrace`, posted by `SalesOrderLineForm` (typing a
     price posts `"null"`), set by `createReplacementSalesOrder`, and copied
     by `convert` from the converted break via `quoteToOrderPriceTrace`
     (`packages/database/src/price-trace.ts`), which appends the quote line discount so
     the trace ends at the order line's net price.
   - `quoteLine.priceTrace` is dead — one trace cannot describe several breaks.
     Nothing fills it; `get-method` `quoteToQuote` copies it (always null).
   `getQuoteLinePriceTraces` (`x+/quote+/$quoteId.$lineId.price-trace.tsx`
   loader, `shouldRevalidate` false — it is expensive, so the grid loads it
   only on modal open, after a reprice, and once on mount for a line with an
   untraced system price) returns each break's stored `trace` plus a
   `currentTrace`: today's
   pipeline re-run from the base the row's builder starts from (cost-plus
   rollup with the row's markups / configured sale price for Make to Order,
   supplier break for Purchase to Order, item sale price for Pull from
   Inventory); none for a `manual` row. It calls
   `buildCostEffects(..., { refreshBuyCosts: false })` so the read never writes
   `quoteMaterial.unitCost`. The route's action, `repriceQuoteLineFromRules`,
   stores each `currentTrace` and its final price in one
   `upsertQuoteLinePrices` transaction. It refuses a non-Draft quote itself
   (`QuoteLockedError`) because it is also an MCP tool.

`upsertQuoteLinePrices(db, companyId, quoteId, lineId, prices)` deletes and
re-inserts rows **inside one Kysely transaction** (so a failed insert rolls the
delete back instead of leaving the line with no pricing). Per-quantity carry-over
of the user-entered fields (`discountPercent`, `leadTime`, `shippingCost`,
`categoryMarkups`, `priceSource`) is **explicit-wins, omit-preserves**
(`resolvePreservedQuoteLinePriceFields` in `sales.utils.ts`): a value the caller
provides is written, a field the caller omits keeps the stored value for that
quantity, and a brand-new row with neither falls back to the column default —
`priceSource` defaulting to `"manual"` (a hand-set price with no declared source
is a manual override, not a system cost-plus price). This is why the recalc route
(`$quoteId.$lineId.recalculate-price.tsx`) passes ONLY the recomputed `unitPrice`
(+ explicit `priceSource: "system"`) and omits lead time / discount / shipping —
so the user's entries survive. When an explicit `prices` array is passed, the
rewrite also **syncs `quoteLine.quantity`** to the sorted distinct quantities of
the rows (the precision rebuild, which omits `prices`, leaves the breaks alone).
It takes a `Kysely<KyselyDatabase>`, not a supabase client, so it bypasses RLS —
every statement is scoped by `companyId` explicitly and the route must authorize
with `requirePermissions` first. Any user-entered column added to `quoteLinePrice`
has to be added to `resolvePreservedQuoteLinePriceFields` or the delete+reinsert
silently resets it to its default.
The rewrite throws if the quote or line is missing for that company, because the
insert's `companyId` is overwritten by a trigger from the parent quote — without
the check it would write into whichever company owns the quote. An **empty**
`prices` array is a no-op, not a wipe: dropping a quantity break is
`reconcileQuantityBreaks`' job, so an empty rewrite leaves the rows alone.

`updateQuoteLinePrecision(db, companyId, quoteId, lineId, precision)` shares that
transaction: it sets `quoteLine.unitPricePrecision` and re-rounds the existing
price rows together, so the line can never advertise a precision its prices were
never rounded to. `precision` is not validated in app code — `quoteLine` carries
`CHECK ("unitPricePrecision" IN (2,3,4))`, and the update runs before any
rounding, so an out-of-range value aborts the transaction before `toFixed` sees
it.

## Types & UI

- `QuotationPrice` type = a row of `getQuoteLinePrices(...)` (`sales.service.ts`),
  derived in `apps/erp/app/modules/sales/types.ts` (not a hand-written list).
- `PricingRule` type and `PriceTraceStep` also in `types.ts`.
- `pricingRuleValidator` in `sales.models.ts`; Percentage `amount` must be ≤ 1.
- UI: `ui/Quotes/QuoteLinePricing.tsx` (per-quantity discount/markup editing) and
  the `ui/Pricing/` folder (`PricingRuleForm`, `PricingRulesTable`, `PriceOverrideForm`,
  `PriceTraceModal`). `PriceTraceModal` (calculator icon → modal; sales order line,
  price list) renders `PriceTraceTable`; the quote grid's Unit Price row shows a
  calculator `IconButton` only when `hasPriceAdjustments` finds an override, rule or
  configuration step in some break's stored trace (from the grid's own price
  rows — no request) or fetched current trace, and opens
  `QuoteLinePriceTraceModal`: one `PriceTraceTable` per quantity from the
  stored trace (today's calculation for a row priced before traces were
  recorded), a "repricing gives X" note when today's final price differs at the
  line's precision (`repricedUnitPrice`, `sales.utils.ts`), and a **Reprice with current rules** button on a Draft
  quote.
- Every path that turns a cost rollup into a quote line price runs it through
  `resolvePrice` as `existingBasePrice` with the line's `configuration`: the server
  builders and `recalculateQuoteLinePrices`, and the pricing grid's **Markup %** and
  per-category markup edits (`resolveRollupPrice` → `api/sales/resolve-price`).
  Computing `cost × markup` alone drops the pricing rules and the configuration
  prices. The `get-method` server function seeds rows at cost-plus only, so every
  ERP route that invokes it on a quote line (`itemToQuoteLine`,
  `quoteLineToQuoteLine`) follows with `recalculateQuoteLinePrices`. A typed unit
  price or markup percent is a manual price and is never repriced.
- A **configured** Make to Order line whose part has a unit sale price starts from
  that sale price instead of the cost rollup — the base its sales order line uses —
  so the configuration prices land on the same base on the quote and the order
  (`configuredQuoteBasePrice` in `sales.utils.ts`, used by
  `buildMakeToOrderPriceRows` and `recalculateQuoteLinePrices`). Such rows store
  `categoryMarkups = {}`. A row whose markups someone chose (**Markup %** or a
  category edit — anything other than empty or the company defaults it was seeded
  with) stays cost-plus. Unconfigured lines are always cost-plus.

## Gotchas

- `discountPercent` is a **fraction (0..1)**, not 0..100. `categoryMarkups` values are
  whole percent; `companySettings.quoteLineCategoryMarkups` defaults are stored as
  fractions and multiplied by 100 when used as fallback.
- The doc's old claim that `markupPercent`/`extendedPrice` exist on `quoteLinePrice` is
  **wrong** — they were dropped in 2024. Markup now lives in `categoryMarkups` (rollup)
  and `pricingRule` (engine).
- `quoteLinePrice` has **no `id`** — PK is `(quoteLineId, quantity)`.
- Sales orders/invoices: `salesOrderLine` carries `pricingRuleId` + `priceTrace`
  (the trace propagates from the quote through `convert`; nothing writes
  `pricingRuleId`), but invoice lines do not. Quote→order
  conversion goes through the `convert` server function (`convertQuoteToOrder`).
