        1. In Mount, go to Settings → API → API Clients and press Create. Give
        the client a name, for example <span className="font-mono">carbon</span>
        .
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        2. On the client, set <strong>Member ID</strong> to a member allowed to
        view and edit companies and objects — every request acts as that member
        and inherits their permissions — and press Save. Leave{" "}
        <strong>Allow direct key auth</strong> off: it applies to Mount's MCP
        endpoint, not the API Carbon uses.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        3. Copy the <strong>Client ID</strong> from the top of the client into
        the field below. Then, under Create secret, name the secret, optionally
        set an expiry, and press Create secret. Copy the key straight away —
        Mount shows it once — and paste it into Client secret.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        4. Tenant is the first part of your Mount web address. At{" "}
        <span className="font-mono">acme.mount.cloud</span> the tenant is{" "}
        <span className="font-mono">acme</span>.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        5. Domain is only needed when your Mount tenant is split into several
        (quality, ESG, information security) and Carbon should work within one
        of them. Enter the domain's title as Mount shows it, for example{" "}
        <span className="font-mono">Quality</span>, or its identifier from the
        address bar. Leave it empty otherwise.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        6. For the part definition, go to Settings → Definitions → Objects.
        Mount has no built-in part entity, so if there is no definition for
        parts, press New to create one. Open it and read the slug from the
        address bar:{" "}
        <span className="font-mono">/settings/definitions/objects/parts</span>{" "}
        means the slug is <span className="font-mono">parts</span>.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        7. For the company types, go to Settings → Types → Company types and
        copy the titles used for customers and suppliers exactly as shown,
        creating them with New if needed. Without them, published companies
        appear under All but under neither the Customers nor the Suppliers tab.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-3 text-sm text-muted-foreground">
        If the integration reports unhealthy after saving, re-check the Member
        ID in step 2 — a client with no member is refused on every request.
        Saving these settings again re-runs the check immediately; otherwise the
        status refreshes within five minutes.
