/**
 * Applying ledger delegation: when another system posts a GL family, Carbon
 * must stop sending BOTH that family's journals and its backing documents.
 *
 * Each half alone is wrong, which is why this is one derivation rather than two
 * settings a human keeps in sync:
 *
 * - `families[x] = "none"` alone does NOT stop the document push —
 *   `reconcileDocument` never reads `families`, only `entityPushEnabled`.
 * - disabling the entity alone parks a `DOC_SYNC_DISABLED` Warning on every
 *   posted document forever (`posting.ts`), because the policy then sees a
 *   document-represented journal whose backing document does not sync.
 *
 * WHICH entity to disable is derived from `POSTING_POLICY`, never hard-coded.
 * That table already declares each source type's family and backing entity, so
 * delegating `ap` disables `bill` AND `reimbursement` — the latter landed after
 * this rule was written and needed no edit. A version hard-coding `"bill"`
 * would have kept pushing reimbursements to the GL alongside the other
 * system's copy.
