 *
 * A revalidation that starts during a save does harm:
 * - during the action, React Router drops the fetcher's redirect;
 * - during the navigation that follows the save, it restarts that navigation
 *   without the submission, so the page loads twice and anything that reads
 *   "this follows a save" from the navigation no longer sees it.
 *
 * A call made while a fetcher is submitting or a navigation is in flight is
 * held and runs once the router is idle. The promise of a held call resolves
 * at once, before that reload: awaiting it does not wait for the data.
