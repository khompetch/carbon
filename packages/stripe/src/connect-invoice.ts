/**
 * One Carbon `salesInvoiceLine`, as the Stripe mapping needs to see it.
 *
 * Every amount is in the INVOICE currency — the currency the Stripe invoice is
 * created in — never the company's base currency. The cost components are NOT
 * interchangeable and — apart from `unitPrice` — are NOT per-unit. This mirrors
 * the `salesInvoices` view, which is the single definition of what a Carbon
 * sales invoice is worth (migration `20261006221401_sales-invoice-discount-and-ship-to.sql`),
 * applied to the `converted*` columns:
 *
 *   net      = unitPrice·(1 − discountPercent)
 *   subtotal = Σ (quantity·net + addOnCost + nonTaxableAddOnCost + shippingCost)
 *   totalTax = Σ taxPercent·(quantity·net + addOnCost + shippingCost)
 *   total    = subtotal + totalTax + salesInvoiceShipment.shippingCost
 *
 * The line discount is already applied by the caller: `unitPrice` here IS the
 * net price (`toStripeInvoiceLines`), so the Stripe items and
 * `expectedConnectInvoiceTotal` read one number and cannot disagree.
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating out loud, because each one is a way to bill
 * the customer an amount Carbon's ledger disagrees with:
 *  - `nonTaxableAddOnCost` counts toward the subtotal but NOT the tax base.
 *  - the header-level shipping cost is added AFTER tax and is never taxed.
 *  - `setupPrice` appears in neither sum, so it is deliberately absent from
 *    this type. Billing it would collect more cash than the invoice is owed,
 *    and `recordStripeConnectPayment` settles whatever Stripe collected.

/**
 * Carbon invoice lines → the Stripe mapping's line input.
 *
 * Comment lines carry no money and exist only to annotate the printed invoice,
 * so they are dropped rather than sent as zero-amount items.
 *
 * Every amount is the line's `converted*` column: Stripe bills in the invoice's
 * own currency, and the unprefixed `unitPrice` / `addOnCost` / `shippingCost` /
 * `nonTaxableAddOnCost` are the company's BASE currency. Sending those under
 * the invoice's `currencyCode` billed a EUR invoice its USD amounts.
 * `taxPercent` stays the fraction the column stores.
 *
 * The line discount (`discountPercent`, a fraction) is applied through the
 * unit price: the price sent is `convertedNetUnitPrice`, the generated
 * `unitPrice × exchangeRate × (1 − discountPercent)`, unrounded — Stripe takes
 * a decimal unit amount and rounds once per item, after the quantity — and the
 * description says "(20% off)". It discounts the merchandise only, as the
 * `salesInvoices` view does — add-ons and shipping pass through at full price.
 * Stripe coupons are not used: a coupon discounts the whole invoice, and
 * per-line discounts would not round-trip.
