# @carbon/stripe

Stripe billing integration — checkout, subscriptions, webhooks, and customer sync. **Cloud edition only.**

## Always

- **Route all subscription state writes through `syncStripeDataToKV()`** — it's the single writer of `companyPlan` from Stripe; both webhook and GET re-sync funnel through it
- **Use `normalizePlanId()` before comparing plans** — DB stores partner tiers as `PARTNER-300/400/500`; normalize collapses onto `Plan.Partner`
- **Query `companyPlan` by `.eq("id", companyId)`** — the `id` column IS the company id (not a generated `id('cplan')`)
- **Guard for null `stripe` client** — `stripe` is `null` when `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is unset (non-Cloud); all functions must handle this

## Ask First

- Adding new Stripe webhook event handlers (coordinate with `processStripeEvent` flow)
- Changing plan catalog (`plan` table seeds) or price IDs
- Modifying the bypass mechanism (`STRIPE_BYPASS_COMPANY_IDS/USER_IDS`)

## Never

- Add subscription-status logic outside `syncStripeDataToKV` — it's the one source of truth
- Commit real Stripe price IDs or secrets — use test-mode overrides from `database/src/seed/stripe.ts`
- Skip signature verification in the webhook handler

## Validation Commands

```bash
pnpm --filter @carbon/stripe typecheck   # tsgo --noEmit
pnpm --filter @carbon/stripe dev:stripe  # local Stripe listener (dev)
```

## Key Patterns

- **Exports**: `@carbon/stripe/stripe.server` (platform billing),
  `@carbon/stripe/connect.server` (Connect accounts, invoicing, Connect webhooks),
  `@carbon/stripe/connect.constants`, `@carbon/stripe/send-sales-invoice.server`
  (the send of a posted sales invoice, below) — all server-only — plus
  `@carbon/stripe/connect-invoice`, the pure line mapping (`toStripeInvoiceLines`,
  `expectedConnectInvoiceTotal`, no client or env), tested in
  `packages/jobs/src/invoicing/stripe-invoice-lines.test.ts`
- **Send a posted sales invoice**: `sendPostedSalesInvoiceViaStripe`
  (`send-sales-invoice.server.ts`) is the ONE send, shared by the ERP post route
  (`x+/sales-invoice+/$invoiceId.post.tsx`) and invoice automation
  (`sendPostedInvoiceViaStripe` in `@carbon/jobs` `src/invoicing/automate-invoice.ts`,
  the `Post and Send via Stripe` mode). The caller resolves and links the Stripe
  customer first. The mapping write is injected as `linkStripeInvoice`, so this
  package never depends on `@carbon/ee`. It throws when the invoice cannot be read,
  created, sent or linked; after the send, storing the PDF and writing the payment
  link to the notes are best-effort (a retry would create a SECOND Stripe invoice).
  Same file: `getStripeConnectAccountId` (null until onboarding can accept
  charges — `active` alone is not enough), `getLinkedStripeCustomerId`,
  `toStripeInvoiceLines` (re-exported from `connect-invoice`), `STRIPE_CONNECT_INTEGRATION`
- **Redis cache**: subscription state cached by customer ID; `companyPlan` is the durable mirror
- **GTM forwarding**: `gtm-events.server.ts` forwards invoice events to Google Tag Manager
- **User-based pricing**: `updateSubscriptionQuantityForCompany()` syncs active user count (excludes `@carbon.ms`)
- **Stripe API version**: `2025-06-30.basil` on the shared v1 `stripe` client
  (`2026-07-29.dahlia` on the v2 `stripeConnect` client used for account management).
  On basil, `invoice.charge` / `invoice.payment_intent` no longer exist — payments
  hang off `invoice.payments` (see `getConnectInvoicePaymentDetails`)
- **Two webhook endpoints, two secrets**: the platform endpoint
  (`/api/webhook/stripe`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, verified inside
  `processStripeEvent`) and the Connect endpoint (`/api/webhook/stripe-connect`,
  `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, verified by `constructConnectWebhookEvent`).
  Connected-account events carry `event.account`; verifying one against the wrong
  secret always fails
- **Money conversion**: `toStripeAmount` / `fromStripeAmount` handle zero- and
  three-decimal currencies — never hand-roll `* 100`. Per-unit prices go through
  the SDK's branded `Stripe.Decimal` (`unit_amount_decimal` / `quantity_decimal`
  are `Decimal`, not `string`), never a rounded minor-unit integer
- **Sales invoice → Stripe invoice**: `createAndSendConnectInvoice` mirrors the
  `salesInvoices` view's arithmetic, which is the only definition of what a
  Carbon invoice is worth, in the INVOICE currency: `toStripeInvoiceLines` reads
  the line's `converted*` columns (the unprefixed ones are base currency), and
  the header `salesInvoiceShipment.shippingCost` is converted with
  `toDocumentAmount` at the currency's `decimalPlaces`. One Carbon line becomes up to four Stripe items
  (`unitPrice × quantity`, `addOnCost`, `shippingCost` — all taxable — plus an
  untaxed `nonTaxableAddOnCost`). The line discount (`discountPercent`, a fraction)
  is applied to the merchandise item only: `toStripeInvoiceLines` sends the NET unit
  price `convertedNetUnitPrice` unrounded and says "(20% off)" in the description;
  add-ons and shipping go at full price, and Stripe coupons are not used (a coupon
  discounts the whole invoice), and `salesInvoiceShipment.shippingCost` is a
  fifth, untaxed, invoice-level item. `setupPrice` is in neither the view's
  subtotal nor its tax base, so it is **not billed**. `salesInvoiceLine.taxPercent`
  is a FRACTION in [0,1] (a column CHECK) and must be ×100 for Stripe's
  `percentage`; rates are looked-up-or-created per connected account by
  `resolveConnectTaxRateId`. Before finalizing, the draft's Stripe-computed
  total is reconciled against `expectedConnectInvoiceTotal` and the draft is
  deleted rather than sent on a mismatch beyond per-item rounding. Every Stripe
  write of the send carries an idempotency key derived from
  `ConnectInvoiceInput.idempotencyKey` (`carbon-invoice-<account>-<invoiceId>`;
  `-item-<n>`, `-finalize`, `-send`), so a retry after Stripe succeeded replays
  the same invoice instead of creating a second one. Stripe keeps a key for 24
  hours and refuses a reused key whose parameters changed, so the send's
  parameters must not move with the clock: the due and issue dates are decided
  on whole company calendar days (`stripeDueDate` / `stripeEffectiveDate` in
  `connect-invoice.ts` — a due date on or before today, and an issue date of
  today or later, are left unset, never replaced with "now"). A retry that
  straddles the company's midnight can still change them; Stripe then refuses
  it (a safe failure, never a duplicate) until the key expires
- **Connect customers**: `upsertConnectCustomer` (create/update),
  `retrieveConnectCustomer` (null on missing OR `deleted`, so a stale mapping
  degrades instead of throwing), `findConnectCustomersByEmail` (`customers.list`,
  NOT `customers.search` — search lags indexing and would duplicate a
  just-created customer; `limit: 2` so callers can detect ambiguity). Every call
  passes `{ stripeAccount }`; a platform-scoped call lands on the wrong account.
  `invoice_prefix` and `tax_id_data` are create-only (`tax_id_data` is absent
  from `CustomerUpdateParams` entirely — changing tax ids means
  `createTaxId`/`deleteTaxId`). `ConnectCustomerInput.taxExempt` is already in
  Stripe's vocabulary (`none`/`exempt`/`reverse`); interpreting Carbon's
  `customerTax` pair is the ERP's job, in
  `apps/erp/app/modules/invoicing/stripe-customer.mapper.ts`
