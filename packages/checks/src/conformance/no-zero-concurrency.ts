/**
 * Matches `limit: 0` inside an Inngest `concurrency` block.
 *
 * `[^{}]*?` cannot cross a brace, so the match is confined to the concurrency
 * object itself — an unrelated `limit: 0` after it closes (a query limit, a
 * pagination default) is not flagged. A bounded `[\s\S]` span would reach past
 * the `}` and match `concurrency: {}, const q = { limit: 0 }`.
 *
 * The concurrency object contains no nested braces in practice (`limit`, `key`,
 * `scope` are all scalars), so excluding braces entirely is exact rather than
 * approximate.
