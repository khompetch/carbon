/**
 * Server code must not derive calendar days from the process timezone. The
 * banned idioms silently disagree with each other whenever TZ ≠ UTC:
 * - getLocalTimeZone() on a server = the server's zone, not the user's
 * - new Date().toISOString().split("T")[0] / .slice(0, 10) = the UTC day
 * - new Date().getDay()/getDate()/... = date parts of "now" in the process zone
 * - d.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0) = midnight in the process zone
 * Use datetime.today(tz) / datetime.businessDay(instant, tz) with a timezone
 * resolved from company.timezone (ledger-scoped) or location.timezone
 * (operational). Full-instant new Date().toISOString() stays allowed —
 * timestamps are timezone-free. UTC getters (getUTCDay etc.) and local getters
 * on a locally-constructed date (new Date(y, m, d).getFullYear() roundtrips)
 * are also fine and deliberately not matched.
