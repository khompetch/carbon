/**
 * Mount publish sweep — the "Push customers / suppliers / parts" actions on
 * the Mount integration's detail page.
 *
 * Carbon is the master for all three; Mount is a downstream mirror that is
 * never read back. The sweep finds records Mount is missing or holds stale
 * (no mapping row, or the Carbon row changed after it was last published)
 * and pushes them one at a time.
 *
 * The sweep IS the retry. A record that fails is still stale on the next run,
 * so there is no operation ledger to keep truthful and no queue to drain —
 * deliberately less machinery than the accounting sync, which needs provable
 * completeness because it moves money.
 *
 * Started from the integration's actions today. A cron is a second trigger on
 * this same function, iterating every active Mount integration; nothing here
 * assumes a human started it.
