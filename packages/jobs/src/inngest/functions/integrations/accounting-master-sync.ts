/**
 * One-shot master-data sync — customers, vendors and items, in either
 * direction, for any accounting provider.
 *
 * Replaces two jobs that were mirror images of each other:
 *
 * - `accounting-backfill` pushed unmapped Carbon records out. It also carried a
 *   journal-disposition phase (now `accounting-journal-backfill`) and two PULL
 *   phases that could never run — they gated on the entity's configured
 *   `direction`, and all three providers force master data to
 *   `push-to-accounting` / `owner: "carbon"`, so `shouldPull` was always false.
 * - `rillet-import-contacts` pulled remote contacts in. It existed precisely
 *   BECAUSE that direction gate made the backfill's pull unreachable, so it
 *   enqueued `pull-from-accounting` operations explicitly — the same override
 *   the inbound webhook path uses.
 *
 * That override is why `direction` is a payload field rather than something
 * read from the sync config: a pull here is a person saying "import what is
 * already there", not the automatic direction. `owner: "carbon"` still protects
 * a linked record — `pullBatchFromAccounting` skips it — so re-running is safe.
 *
 * What the pull is FOR is the mapping row. Once a Carbon customer is linked to
 * a remote one, `upsertRemote` resolves that mapping before writing, so an
 * invoice raised later updates the original remote record instead of creating a
 * second one.
 *
 * Provider-agnostic by construction: enumeration goes through
 * `provider.listRemoteEntityIds` (declared via `capabilities.importableEntities`)
 * and pushes through the shared mapping service, so adding a provider needs no
 * edit here.
