/**
 * v5 reconciler decision core (spec:
 * .ai/specs/2026-08-12-accounting-sync-reconciler-unification.md, D1).
 *
 * ONE pure, state-shaped answer to "what should happen for this entity right
 * now?" — subsuming the decision logic that previously lived in five places
 * (the event path's per-table branches, the cooldown/transition routing, and
 * the sweep's document/payment diffs and re-drive rules). The event handler,
 * the outbound sweep, and any future caller are just callers: they load
 * state, ask, and apply.
 *
 * Import-light on purpose (no Inngest, no @carbon/auth): the golden decision
 * matrix (reconcile-golden.test.ts) exercises this exhaustively without
 * booting anything.
 *
 * Level-triggered semantics: the decision never looks at what CHANGED (no
 * event deltas, no old/new rows) — only at what IS. Idempotence follows: the
 * same state always produces the same decision, and a decision whose work is
 * already recorded produces "nothing". That is what makes lost events, burst
 * duplicates, and cooldown races unrepresentable rather than specially
 * handled.
