 * Each source is a superset of what `runMrp` reads (projections and actuals
 * are not narrowed to the planning horizon), so a company is only left out
 * when a run would be a no-op.
 *
 * With no demand and no supply, the planning actions still size an Order /
 * Make from on-hand alone (`generatePlanningActions`: the shared sizing, and
 * the Stock Only reserve), and each of those fires only below a positive
 * floor or on negative stock: a Demand-Based Reorder item under its safety
 * stock, a Fixed Reorder Quantity / Maximum Quantity item under its reorder
 * point, a superseded item under its minimum reserve — or any policy but
 * Manual Reorder below zero. Those are the last two sources. "Not Manual
 * Reorder" alone is no filter: it is the column's default.
