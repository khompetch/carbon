// A contract line's position: invoiced − recognized. Deferred Revenue carries
// the positive part, Contract Assets the negative part, and every movement —
// an invoice, a recognition, a credit memo, a VOID, the opening balance of a
// migrated contract — goes through `applyContractMovement`, so invoice
// posting, post-memo and the recognition run can never disagree about which
// account a movement hits.
//
// Both pools are kept in contract currency and in base. Base is carried at a
// weighted-average rate per pool (SAP RAR; .ai/research/contract-exchange-rates.md
// open question 7): drawing on a pool takes its carried base, adding to it
// takes the movement's own rate. When the other side of the entry is a
// receivable (an invoice or a credit), the receivable is at the document's
// rate and the difference is realized FX — never revenue. When it is revenue
// (the recognition run), revenue takes exactly the base the pools move.
