-- Make to Asset: complete_job_to_inventory gains a job→asset branch.
-- A job with "fixedAssetClassId" completes into one new fixed asset per unit,
-- which needs a serialized item (an asset with no tracked unit cannot be returned
-- to inventory or capitalized); a job with "fixedAssetId" sweeps its WIP onto that
-- Construction in Progress asset. The units never enter stock: no itemLedger,
-- costLedger, pickMethod or itemCost rows are written, the WIP discharge posts to
-- the class's asset account as an 'Asset Transfer' journal, and the assets are
-- priced from the swept WIP.
