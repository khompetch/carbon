-- Planning horizon (time fence) for MRP planning actions.
--
-- MRP keeps generating actions over the whole planning window; the horizon is a
-- READ-TIME lens: the planning grids surface only the actions (and suggested new
-- orders) that fall on or before today + horizon days. Empty or 0 = no fence;
-- an item's 0 also opts it out of the company default, which empty inherits.
--
-- Named planningHorizonDays on purpose: planningTimeFenceDays is reserved by the
-- MRP v2 spec for the auto-firm fence, which is a different concept.
--
-- The fence is compared against planningAction."horizonDate", defined with the
-- table in 20261006130000_mrp-planning-actions.sql.

-- 1. Per item + location horizon, with a company-wide default.
ALTER TABLE "itemPlanning"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "planningHorizonDays" INTEGER
  CHECK ("planningHorizonDays" IS NULL OR "planningHorizonDays" >= 0);

ALTER TABLE "companySettings"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "defaultPlanningHorizonDays" INTEGER
  CHECK ("defaultPlanningHorizonDays" IS NULL OR "defaultPlanningHorizonDays" >= 0);

-- 2. Grid wrappers. The base RPCs stay the one definition of the projection
--    (generatePlanningActions reads them too); these add the columns only the
--    grids need and evaluate the Actions and Assignee filters in the
--    database, inside each item's fence, so the filter is complete at any volume
--    and paging stays correct.
--
--    SECURITY INVOKER: the base RPC asserts company access; everything joined
--    here runs under the caller's RLS.
--
--    `p.*` ties the column list below to the base RPC's. Adding a column to a
--    base RPC means re-creating its wrapper with the same column — the wrapper
--    fails loudly (return type mismatch) until then.
