-- Sales invoices: a line discount, a customer ship-to, and the three views over them.
--
-- 1) Sales invoice lines carry a discount (.ai/specs/2026-10-02-contracts.md). A
-- fraction 0..1 like quoteLinePrice.discountPercent. It discounts merchandise
-- (quantity x unitPrice) only: add-ons and shipping are not discounted, and tax is
-- charged on the discounted merchandise. Existing rows default to 0.

ALTER TABLE "salesInvoiceLine"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "discountPercent" NUMERIC NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
DO $$ BEGIN
  ALTER TABLE "salesInvoiceLine" ADD CONSTRAINT "salesInvoiceLine_discountPercent_check"
    CHECK ("discountPercent" >= 0 AND "discountPercent" <= 1);
EXCEPTION WHEN duplicate_object THEN NULL; END $$;
ALTER TABLE "salesInvoiceLine"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "netUnitPrice" NUMERIC
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS ("unitPrice" * (1 - "discountPercent")) STORED,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "convertedNetUnitPrice" NUMERIC
    GENERATED ALWAYS AS ("unitPrice" * "exchangeRate" * (1 - "discountPercent")) STORED;

-- 2) A sales invoice's customer ship-to, as on salesOrderShipment. A contract copies
--    its ship-to here when it drafts an invoice; an invoice converted from an order
--    copies the order's.
ALTER TABLE "salesInvoiceShipment"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "customerLocationId" TEXT REFERENCES "customerLocation"("id");
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS "salesInvoiceShipment_customerLocationId_idx"

-- 3) Views. salesInvoiceLines: DROP + CREATE so sl.* picks up every new line column
-- (rental, service dates, contract provenance, discount).

-- line discount, the automation columns (20261006221101_rental-invoice-automation.sql)
-- and needsReview: a held draft, or a posted invoice whose email failed. Only a posted
-- invoice can be unsent (isPostedSalesInvoice in packages/jobs/src/invoicing/
