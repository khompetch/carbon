-- Specific identification for serialized units. A cost layer booked for ONE
-- serial unit (a fixed asset returned to stock at its net book value, a
-- sales-type lease residual returned at its closing net investment, an
-- unscrap, a positive adjustment of a serial) records that unit, and
-- calculateCOGS relieves the unit leaving from its own layer instead of the
-- oldest one. NULL for every layer that covers many units (receipts, job
-- output), which keep FIFO / LIFO order.
