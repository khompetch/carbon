 *  over Intl/CLDR, and never a literal. It is always the MAXIMUM.
 *
 *  `minDecimalPlaces` decides whether the non-significant zeros it implies are
 *  kept, and DEFAULTS to keeping them: "$300.00", "$3.50", "$0.00", "¥63".
 *  Fixed-width money is the accounting convention — it keeps columns of amounts
 *  aligned and an explicit ".00" reads as money rather than a bare count. Pass 0
 *  to drop the padding ("$300", "$3.5"); that is a per-company display
 *  preference (`companySettings.showCurrencyTrailingZeros`), which is why it is
 *  a parameter here rather than a second kind.

 *  its FLOOR, not its ceiling. Above that it carries the storage scale.
 *
 *  Money and price differ by ROLE, which is why this is a second function and

 *
 *    settlement (total, line amount, payment, tax) -> what someone PAYS,

 *
 *  Every ERP splits these. Xero settles at 2 but takes 4 on UnitAmount (opt-in
 *  `unitdp=4`); QuickBooks Desktop settles at 2 and shows 5 in the Rate column;
 *  SAP keeps money at the currency's decimals and reaches sub-cent prices with a
 *  price unit (per 100/1000) instead. None of them widens settlement values.
 *
 *  On an editable field this is not decoration: react-aria commits
 *  `parse(format(x))`, so the ceiling here is what a typed price is STORED at.
