/**
 * True when a navigation only changed the search params of the page we are
 * already on — a table filter, sort, page, or drawer toggle.
 *
 * These are by far the most frequent navigations in the app, and none of them
 * can change app-shell data: no mutation ran and the route didn't change. So a
 * shell-level `shouldRevalidate` can skip them.
 *
 * Note what this does NOT cover: `useRevalidator().revalidate()` (how the
 * realtime hooks refresh) also presents as same-pathname with no form method,
 * so a shell loader using this will not re-run for realtime events either.
 * Leaf loaders still refresh, which is the intent — but shell data that must
 * react to a realtime change needs its own path in `shouldRevalidate`.
