/**
 * Makes React Router's per-request `context` readable from anywhere on the
 * server, without threading it through every function signature.
 *
 * React Router already gives each request a `RouterContextProvider` and hands it
 * to middleware, loaders and actions. What it does not give you is a way to read
 * it from a plain service function — so anything that wants request-scoped state
 * (`requirePermissions`, a logger, a DB client) has to take `context` as an
 * argument, which for an existing codebase means touching every call site.
 *
 * Storing the provider itself in an AsyncLocalStorage closes that gap: ALS
 * propagates through the async call tree, so every loader running inside
 * `next()` — and everything they call — can reach the same provider. The values
 * still live in React Router's own typed `createContext` slots; ALS only
 * provides the access path.
 *
 * Safety: the provider is per-request and ALS gives each concurrent request its
 * own store, so one request can never observe another's values. Outside a
 * request (Inngest jobs, edge functions, tests) `getRouterContext()` is
 * undefined and callers fall back to computing directly.
 *
 * A WeakMap keyed on the `Request` does NOT work as a substitute: React Router
 * does not hand the same Request instance to every matched loader, so such a
 * memo never hits (measured — no change in per-request claim lookups).
