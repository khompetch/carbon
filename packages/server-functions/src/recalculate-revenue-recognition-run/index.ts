// Rebuilds a Draft revenue recognition run from the schedule as it is now. A
// Draft is a snapshot: rows that fell due after it was proposed are not in it,
// and posting refuses it as out of date. Recalculating keeps the run's id and
// number, releases every row it held, and claims what is due by its period end
// again — the same rows a fresh proposal would, through the same synthesizers.
