// Pure resolver for a spare part returned from a maintenance dispatch: how much
// of the return carries value, and at what unit cost.
//
// A return reverses what the dispatch actually expensed, so it reads the
// dispatch's own 'Maintenance Consumption' cost-ledger rows for the item
// (signed: issues negative, earlier returns positive) and books at their
// blended issue cost — a round trip nets zero P&L. Only the quantity still
// expensed (issued minus already returned) is valued: an issue posted before
// maintenance consumption carried value has no cost row, so returning it must
// not credit an expense that was never debited. Returns null when nothing is
// left to reverse — the caller writes the ledger row alone.
