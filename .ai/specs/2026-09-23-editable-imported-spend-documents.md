## TLDR

A `charge` arrives from a spend provider (Ramp) and is posted immediately today, so a human
never sees it in an editable state and its coding is whatever the provider sent. This spec
makes an imported spend document **land as Draft, be editable in Carbon — header and coding
lines, including adding and removing lines — and post only when a human is satisfied**. It
also makes the originating provider **first-class in the UI**: its logo, its external id, and
an Activity entry recording the import. Carbon still never *creates* these documents by hand;
they are always records of something that happened in the spend tool. Reimbursements adopt the
identical model.

## Problem Statement

### 1. There is no editable moment

`ramp-sync` stages a Draft `charge` and immediately invokes `post-charge`, so the row is
`Posted` — and therefore immutable (the lifecycle trigger allows only Draft edits) — before
anyone in Carbon has looked at it. If Ramp's coding is wrong, absent, or coded to an account
that does not suit Carbon's chart, the only remedies are to void and re-create, or to fix it
in Ramp and re-sync. Neither is what an accountant expects.

### 2. Coding cannot be corrected or enriched in Carbon

`chargeLine` already carries `accountId`, `costCenterId`, `projectId`, `description` and
`amount`, but nothing in the UI can write them — the charge detail route is read-only and
there is no line editor anywhere. So Carbon holds a document whose dimensional coding it
cannot improve, while being the system that owns cost centers and projects.

### 3. Provenance is invisible

`charge.integration` records `'ramp'`, but the UI never shows it. A user cannot tell an
imported charge from any other, cannot see the provider's own identifier for it, and has no
record of when it arrived. Rillet, by contrast, renders the source provider's **logo** as a
labelled `SOURCE` field, shows the external id, and writes an Activity line ("Charge imported
from BREX"). That is the bar.

## Proposed Solution

### Lifecycle: import as Draft, code, then post

| Step | Actor | State |
|---|---|---|
| Sync imports the charge with whatever coding the provider sent | `ramp-sync` | **Draft** |
| Review: correct the header, correct/add/remove coding lines | human, in Carbon | Draft (editable) |
| Post | human | **Posted** (immutable; journal written) |
| Sync onward to the accounting provider | posting sync | — |

This is the one behavioural change to the existing flow: **the sync no longer auto-posts.**
Draft is the review queue. The lifecycle trigger already permits exactly this (Draft edits
allowed, Posted immutable), so no trigger change is needed.

### The sync CREATES; it never re-writes an existing document

A document that already exists in Carbon is **never updated by a later sync run**. The sync
creates the row and its lines once; from then on Carbon's copy is authoritative and the
provider cannot overwrite it.

This is load-bearing, not housekeeping. The existing resume path replaces a Draft's lines on
re-sync, which was harmless when nobody could edit them — but under an editable model it means
a reviewer codes a Draft, the hourly sweep re-runs, and their work is silently gone with no
error and no way to tell it happened. "Provider owns it until it lands; Carbon owns it after"
is the rule, and it is easy to reason about.

The accepted cost: a provider-side correction made *after* import (Ramp re-codes the charge,
say) will not flow through — the reviewer sees what arrived originally. That is the right
trade, because the alternative silently destroys human work, and a human can always re-edit.

### Editing

Cloning the reference UI's two-mode shape:

- **Read mode** — header card (party, amounts, dates, currency, and the SOURCE badge), a
  Line Items table, and a right rail with Activity.
- **Edit mode** — a `Details` card of editable header fields, and a `Line items` card with
  `+ Add line item` (top and bottom), expand/collapse per line, per-line delete, and a
  **running total in the page header** so the user sees the sum against the document amount
  as they type.

The header total must reconcile to the line sum before Post is allowed — `post-charge`
already refuses a `Charge`/`Credit` whose lines do not sum to the header, so the UI surfaces
that invariant rather than inventing one.

### Source attribution, first-class

On the detail header, a labelled **SOURCE** field showing the provider's **logo** and name,
plus the provider's external id beneath it. The logo comes from the integration registry the
settings page already renders (`packages/ee` `integrations[]`), so a new provider gets its
badge with no extra work.

**No activity/timeline surface.** The reference UI shows an Activity rail ("Charge imported
from BREX"), but Carbon has no generic activity table — the audit log is the real history and
`Activity.tsx` is only a row primitive. Building one to match the reference would be inventing
a subsystem for a decoration, so the SOURCE badge carries the provenance and no `importedAt`
column is added. The reference screenshots are a direction, not a specification to match
pixel-for-pixel.

### Line fields, and dimensions via the existing selector

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Account | yes | the GL account the line codes to |
| Amount | yes | lines must sum to the header |
| Description | no | |
| **Dimensions** | no | rendered by the existing `DimensionSelector` |

The reference UI exposes a wide dimension set (Department, Location, Asset Class, Supplier,
Item, Customer, Supplier Type, Employee, Work Center, Process, Item Posting Group). Carbon
does **not** add a column per concept to reach that — it already has the right component:
**`apps/erp/app/modules/accounting/ui/JournalEntries/DimensionSelector.tsx`**, which renders
the company's *configured* dimensions generically, colours each entity type, and serves the
high-cardinality ones (Customer, Supplier, Item) from the client stores through a searchable,
virtualized Combobox rather than eagerly loading them. Reuse it in the line editor rather than
building pickers.

That has one consequence worth stating plainly, because it reverses an earlier draft of this
spec: **v1 therefore DOES need a migration.** `DimensionSelector` works in
`{dimensionId, valueId}` pairs, and a charge line has nowhere to put them — `chargeLine` has
only the two hard-coded columns `costCenterId` and `projectId`. So each document's line needs
a generic child table mirroring `journalLineDimension`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE "chargeLineDimension" (
    "id" TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT id('chgld'),
    "companyId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "chargeLineId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "dimensionId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "valueId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    -- audit columns
    CONSTRAINT "chargeLineDimension_pkey" PRIMARY KEY ("id", "companyId"),
    CONSTRAINT "chargeLineDimension_line_fkey"
      FOREIGN KEY ("chargeLineId", "companyId")
      REFERENCES "chargeLine"("id", "companyId") ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

`post-charge` then writes `journalLineDimension` from these rows instead of from the two
columns. `reimbursementLine` gets the identical child table.

**The existing `costCenterId` / `projectId` columns stay for now** — the Ramp inbound sync
writes them and `post-charge` reads them today, so removing them in the same change would
couple a UI feature to an integration rewrite. Consolidating onto the generic table alone is
the follow-up, and is recorded as an open question rather than assumed.

**Precedence, stated explicitly, because two sources can disagree.** Once both exist, a line
can carry a cost centre in `costCenterId` AND a `chargeLineDimension` row for the cost-centre
dimension, with different values — the Ramp value and the reviewer's. Posting must not pick the
stale one:

1. **The generic `chargeLineDimension` rows win, per `dimensionId`.** They are the only source a
   reviewer can write, and this feature exists so that their coding is what posts.
2. **A column supplies a value only for a `dimensionId` the generic table has no row for.** That
   is what keeps a never-edited imported line posting exactly as it does today.
3. **The line editor promotes before it edits.** On the first write to a line, it copies whatever
   `costCenterId` / `projectId` hold into `chargeLineDimension` rows and nulls the columns, so
   from then on the generic rows are the line's whole dimension set.

Rule 3 is what makes CLEARING possible, and without it the model is broken rather than merely
ambiguous: under rules 1–2 alone, a reviewer who removes a cost centre leaves no generic row,
the column becomes the fallback again, and the value they just deleted posts anyway. De-duplicate
by `dimensionId` AFTER applying this precedence, never before — de-duplicating first discards one
of the two values while the decision is still unmade, and which one survives then depends on the
order the two sources happen to be read in.

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Authoring | **Still never created by hand** | These documents record something that happened in the spend tool; hand-entering one invents a transaction with no counterpart. Import-then-edit is a different thing from create. |
| Sync auto-post | **Stop auto-posting; import as Draft** | Without a Draft window there is no editable moment at all. Draft becomes the review queue. |
| Editable scope | Header + lines, **while Draft only** | Matches the existing lifecycle trigger exactly (Draft edits allowed, Posted immutable) — no trigger change, and posted history stays immutable. |
| Line dimensions | The existing **`DimensionSelector`**, backed by a generic `chargeLineDimension` child table | Carbon already has the component that renders a company's configured dimensions generically, including searchable high-cardinality types. A column per Rillet concept would fight the dimension model and need a migration each. Cost: v1 gains one small table per document type. |
| `costCenterId` / `projectId` columns | **Keep for now**; the generic rows take precedence per `dimensionId`, a column is a fallback only where no row exists, and the line editor promotes the columns into rows on first edit | The Ramp sync writes them and `post-charge` reads them; removing them here would couple this UI feature to an integration rewrite. Precedence has to be stated: a reviewer's edit losing to the stale Ramp value defeats the feature, and without promote-on-edit a cleared dimension silently comes back from the column. |
| Sync re-write | **Create only — never update an existing document's lines** | The resume path replacing lines was harmless when nothing was editable; under an editable model it silently destroys a reviewer's coding. Cost: a provider-side correction after import doesn't flow through. |
| Activity/timeline | **Not built** | Carbon has no generic activity table; the audit log is the real history. Inventing a subsystem for a decoration is the wrong trade — the SOURCE badge carries provenance. |
| Source attribution | Provider logo + name + external id | `charge.integration` already stores the provider; the logo comes from the existing integration registry, so new providers are free. |
| Totals guard | Header total must equal the line sum before Post | Surfaces the invariant `post-charge` already enforces, rather than failing at post time. |
| Detail surface | **Full page, not the Drawer** | Carbon's convention is Drawer detail views, but a multi-line editor with expandable per-line forms does not fit a drawer. This is a deliberate, narrow exception — flagged rather than silently broken. |

## Data Model Changes

**One new table per document type**: `chargeLineDimension` (above) and the identical
`reimbursementLineDimension`, so the existing `DimensionSelector` has somewhere to write.
Everything else already exists — `charge`/`chargeLine` carry the header and line fields,
`charge.integration` records the provider, and the lifecycle trigger already allows Draft
edits and nothing else.

Reimbursements get their tables from the sibling spec; `reimbursementLine` must mirror
`chargeLine` so one line editor serves both.

## API / Service Changes

- `invoicing.service.ts` — `updateCharge` (header) and `upsertChargeLines` / `deleteChargeLine`,
  all refusing a non-Draft parent. Line writes are multi-row, so the Kysely client is built in
  a `.server` helper and passed in from the route action — never constructed in the service
  file (it is barrel-exported to the browser).
- `ramp-sync-card.ts` — stop invoking `post-charge` on import; leave the row Draft.
- A route action to Post a Draft charge (invoking the existing `post-charge` edge function),
  which is what the sync used to do implicitly.

## UI Changes

- `charges.$id.tsx` — read mode: header card with the SOURCE badge (logo + name + external id),
  Line Items table, Activity rail.
- `charges.$id.edit.tsx` (or an edit mode on the same route) — Details card + Line items editor
  with Add/remove, expand/collapse, running total, Cancel/Save.
- A **Post** action on a Draft charge.
- Precedent to clone: `apps/erp/app/modules/invoicing/ui/Charge/` for the table and status,
  and the memo detail/edit routes for the action + flash conventions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A Ramp-imported charge lands **Draft**, not Posted, and appears in the charges list as
      Draft.
- [ ] Its detail page shows a **SOURCE** field with the Ramp **logo**, the provider name, and
      the provider's external id.
- [ ] After a human edits a Draft's lines, re-running the sync leaves those edits intact —
      the sync does not re-write an existing document.
- [ ] Edit mode allows changing header fields and editing an existing line's account, amount
      and description; Save persists all of it.
- [ ] The line editor renders the company's configured dimensions through the existing
      `DimensionSelector` (not bespoke pickers), and a dimension chosen on a line persists to
      `chargeLineDimension`.
- [ ] `+ Add line item` adds a second coding line; the running total in the header updates as
      amounts are typed; removing a line updates it too.
- [ ] Post is refused (with a clear message, before any edge-function call) while the line sum
      does not equal the header amount.
- [ ] Posting a fully-coded Draft charge writes a `journalLineDimension` per line for every
      dimension set on it — from the generic table AND the legacy columns, de-duplicated by
      `dimensionId` — and flips the row to Posted.
- [ ] A **Posted** charge is not editable — edit controls are absent and a direct action is
      refused (the lifecycle trigger is the backstop, not the only guard).
- [ ] Browser-verified end to end via `/test`: import → edit → add line → post.

## Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|------|----------|------------|
| **Not auto-posting changes existing behaviour** — charges that used to post themselves now wait for a human | High | This is the point of the spec, but it is a real workflow change for anyone relying on the current flow. Call it out in the rule and the PR; consider a per-company setting only if a customer actually objects. |
| Drafts pile up unreviewed, so spend never reaches the GL | Med | The charges list defaults to showing Drafts first; the existing Sync Activity tab already surfaces failures. A reviewer queue is the follow-up if volume warrants. |
| A full-page detail diverges from Carbon's Drawer convention | Med | Deliberate and documented above; the line editor does not fit a drawer. |
| Line editor has no precedent in the ERP | Med | Build it as a reusable component from the start, since reimbursements need exactly the same one. |
| Editing a charge already synced onward to the accounting provider | Med | Only Draft rows are editable, and a Draft has not synced — the posting sync fires on Posted. So this cannot arise while the Draft guard holds. |

## Open Questions

- [ ] **Does the sync stop auto-posting for every provider, or only where coding is delegated
      to Carbon?** Why it matters: a customer who codes fully in Ramp gains nothing from a
      Draft queue and may experience it as a regression. Recommended: stop auto-posting
      unconditionally for v1 (simplest, one behaviour), and revisit if a customer wants
      auto-post-when-fully-coded.
- [ ] **Do the `costCenterId` / `projectId` columns get consolidated into the generic
      dimension table, and when?** Why it matters: two sources of truth for the same concept is
      exactly the kind of drift that rots. Recommended: leave both in v1 (posting unions them),
      then migrate the Ramp inbound path onto the generic table and drop the columns as a
      follow-up — not in the same change as the UI.
- [ ] **Full page vs Drawer for the detail surface** — recommended full page, since the line
      editor does not fit a Drawer, but it is a deliberate break from the house convention and
      worth an explicit yes.

## Changelog

- 2026-09-23: The sync creates but never re-writes an existing document, so a reviewer's
  coding cannot be silently destroyed by the next sweep. Dropped the Activity/timeline
  surface — Carbon has no generic activity table and the reference UI is a direction, not a
  pixel specification; the SOURCE badge carries provenance.
- 2026-09-23: Line dimensions use the existing `DimensionSelector` rather than deferring the
  wider set. This reverses the "v1 needs no migration" claim: the selector works in
  `{dimensionId, valueId}` pairs, so each document's line needs a generic child table
  mirroring `journalLineDimension`.
- 2026-09-23: Created, from a review of Rillet's Charge/Reimbursement UI. Supersedes the
  "read and sync only" narrowing recorded earlier the same day in the reimbursements spec:
  these documents are still never hand-created, but they ARE editable after import.
