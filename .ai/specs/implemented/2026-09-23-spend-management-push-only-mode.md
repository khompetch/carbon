## TLDR

A spend-management platform (Ramp today) allows exactly one connected accounting
provider. When a customer wants Ramp → Rillet to be the path for card charges,
reimbursements and bill payments, Carbon cannot hold that seat. This spec adds a
second **install mode** to spend integrations — *push-only* — in which Carbon requests
a reduced OAuth scope set, never touches the accounting connection, pushes purchase
orders, item receipts and provisional bills into the spend platform coded with **the
accounting provider's own identifiers**, and stops forwarding AP to the general ledger
because it now arrives via the spend platform.

Nothing in the design names Ramp or Rillet. Integrations declare a `providerRole`
(`accounting` | `spend`), spend providers declare per-mode capabilities, accounting
providers declare how they address external entities, and every gate reads those
declarations. Adding a second spend platform, or a fourth accounting provider, is a
descriptor entry plus one lookup method.

## Problem Statement

Carbon's Ramp integration assumes Carbon is Ramp's accounting provider: it creates the
Ramp accounting connection, pushes the chart of accounts and cost-center/project fields
as coding options, and pulls charges, bills, reimbursements, transfers, cashbacks,
repayments and bill payments into Carbon's ledger.

A manufacturing customer running Rillet as the GL wants the opposite arrangement:

- Ramp → Rillet carries card charges, reimbursements and bill payments directly.
- Carbon owns purchasing, receiving and the item master, and pushes purchase orders,
  item receipts and provisional vendor bills into Ramp so a human can approve and pay
  them there.
- Carbon must not also send those bills to Rillet, or AP is counted twice.

Four things block this today:

1. **Scopes are one frozen list.** `RAMP_OAUTH_SCOPES` (17 entries including
   `accounting:write`) feeds `config.tsx` → `integration-oauth.ts:20`
   `scopes.join(" ")`. There is no subsetting and no call site that filters it.
   Consent is granted before any setting is read, so a post-install toggle cannot help.
2. **`convergeRamp` unconditionally claims the accounting seat** —
   `ensureRampConnection` creates a connection with `remote_provider_name: "Carbon"`,
   then pushes the chart of accounts, the cost-center field and the project field.
   Every one of those needs `accounting:write`.
3. **Carbon codes with Carbon's identifiers.** `buildLineCodingSelections` emits
   `field_option_external_id = account.id`, and `resolveOrCreateRampSpendVendor` writes
   `external_vendor_id = supplier.id`. Both are correct only while Carbon owns the
   accounting connection. Under Rillet they are identifiers Rillet has never seen.
4. **Nothing suppresses Carbon's AP push.** `syncConfig.entities.bill.enabled` exists
   and is honoured at four layers, but has no UI and no writer; `families.ap` has a UI
   but does not gate the bill document push. Each alone is wrong — see Design
   Decisions.

There is also **no exclusivity mechanism of any kind**: the descriptor expresses no
domain or conflict, and the schema permits several active accounting integrations per
company.

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Provider roles and exclusivity

Add a typed, optional `providerRole?: "accounting" | "spend"` to `IntegrationConfig`
(`packages/ee/src/types.ts`). `category` stays a display string — it is used for badges
and, in one place, as a behavioural test that this replaces.

`providerRole` becomes the single answer to four questions currently answered five
different ways:

| Question | Today | After |
|---|---|---|
| Which integrations are accounting providers? | `Object.values(ProviderID)` (jobs), `ACCOUNTING_SYNC_INTEGRATION_IDS` (`accounting.service.ts:2938`), an inline `["xero","quickbooks","rillet"]` (`x+/accounting+/_layout.tsx:51`), `category === "Accounting"` (`integrations.$id.tsx:647`) | `providerRole === "accounting"` |
| Which are spend providers? | `.eq("id", "ramp")` (`ramp-sweep.ts:23`, `ramp-sync.ts:68`) | `providerRole === "spend"` |
| Which produce sync operations? | `isAccountingInstalled \|\| integration.id === "ramp"` (`integrations.$id.tsx:656`) | `providerRole != null` |
| Which are mutually exclusive? | nothing | same role ⇒ exclusive |

**Exactly one active integration per role per company**, enforced in the database
because there are too many write paths to guard in application code
(`upsertCompanyIntegration`, the `upsert_company_integration_patch` RPC, and each OAuth
callback, several under service-role).

### 1b. One capability surface, discriminated by role

The engine already has a capability mechanism — `ProviderCapabilities` on `BaseProvider`
(`core/types.ts:90`), carrying `transport`, `supportsWebhooks`, `supportsJournalPush`,
`maxJournalDimensionSlots`. **Do not add a second vocabulary for spend providers.** A
second shape would mean every future "can this provider do X?" question starts by asking
"which kind of provider is it?" — reintroducing exactly the branching this spec removes.

One discriminated surface instead:

```ts
type SharedCapabilities = {
  transport: "rest" | "bridge";
  supportsWebhooks: boolean;
  /** How this provider addresses each external entity kind. §4. */
  externalAddressing?: Partial<Record<ExternalIdentityKind, "id" | "code">>;
  /** Entity kinds this provider can search for an existing counterpart. §8. */
  searchableCounterparts?: ExternalIdentityKind[];
};

export type SyncProviderCapabilities =
  | (SharedCapabilities & {
      role: "accounting";
      supportsJournalPush: boolean;
      maxJournalDimensionSlots?: number;
    })
  | (SharedCapabilities & {
      role: "spend";
      /** Carbon creates and owns this platform's accounting-connection seat. */
      ownsRemoteCodingSurface: boolean;
      /** GL families this platform posts instead of Carbon. §5. */
      ownsLedgerFamilies: LedgerFamilyKey[];
    });
```

Shared members stay unnarrowed at the call site; role-specific ones narrow once, and
TypeScript enforces which are reachable. `externalAddressing` and
`searchableCounterparts` are deliberately **shared**, not accounting-only — a spend
platform addresses vendors and options by external id exactly as an accounting provider
does, and Ramp already implements a counterpart search.

**What is NOT a capability:** per-entity enablement. The draft of this spec had
`inbound`/`outbound` boolean maps, which duplicate `GlobalSyncConfig.entities` — the
structure §10 already commits the spend provider to exposing through `getSyncConfig`.
Two sources for "does this entity sync?" is the bug, not the feature. So the mode
contributes a `GlobalSyncConfig` **fragment**, and `isEntityPushEnabled` /
`isInboundFamilyEnabled` read it like everything else.

Because Xero declares no `capabilities` at all, every read needs a documented default:
`role` falls back to `"accounting"`, `externalAddressing` to `{ account: "code" }`,
`searchableCounterparts` to `[]`, `ownsLedgerFamilies` to `[]`.

### 1c. `IntegrationTopology` — one resolved answer per company

Today every consumer re-derives the company's integration landscape, five different
ways. Rather than replacing five ad-hoc lookups with four new ones
(`getInstalledAccountingProvider`, `getInstalledSpendProvider`,
`resolvePayablesOwnership`, `resolveIdentityResolver`), resolve it **once**:

```ts
export type LedgerOwner = { kind: "carbon" } | { kind: "external"; integrationId: string };
export type IdentityScope = { kind: "carbon" } | { kind: "delegated"; toIntegrationId: string };

export type IntegrationTopology = {
  accounting: { integrationId: ProviderID; capabilities: SyncProviderCapabilities } | null;
  spend: {
    integrationId: SpendProviderID;
    mode: string;
    capabilities: SyncProviderCapabilities;
  } | null;
  /** Who posts each GL family. Derived; never stored. §5 */
  ledgerOwnership: Record<LedgerFamilyKey, LedgerOwner>;
  /** Whose identifiers a given outbound target expects. Derived; never stored. §4 */
  identityScope(targetIntegrationId: string): IdentityScope;
};

export function resolveIntegrationTopology(
  client: SupabaseClient<Database>,
  companyId: string
): Promise<IntegrationTopology>;
```

One read — it rides the already-Redis-cached `getCompanyIntegrations` — and one object
threaded down. This is the required argument to `resolveSyncConfig` /
`resolvePostingSyncSettings` (§5), the input to the identity resolver (§4), and the
replacement for the four hard-coded provider-id lists (§1). A consumer never asks "is
Rillet installed"; it asks the topology a question about roles and ownership.

### 2. Spend provider descriptor and install modes

New package area `packages/ee/src/spend/`, parallel to `packages/ee/src/accounting/`.
A mode is a scope set plus a capability set plus a sync-config fragment — nothing else:

```ts
export type InstallMode = {
  id: string;                       // "provider" | "push-only" — opaque to the engine
  label: string;
  description: string;
  scopes: string[];
  capabilities: SyncProviderCapabilities;
  /** Ceiling on what any stored toggle may enable. */
  syncConfig: Partial<GlobalSyncConfig["entities"]>;
};

export type SpendProviderDescriptor = {
  id: SpendProviderID;
  modes: InstallMode[];
};
```

Every branch reads capabilities or the resolved sync config — never a mode id, never an
integration id. `convergeRamp` becomes:

```ts
if (caps.ownsRemoteCodingSurface) {
  await ensureRampConnection(...);
  await pushChartOfAccounts(...); await pushCostCenters(...); await pushProjects(...);
}
```

Note those collapse into **one** capability. The draft had `ownsAccountingConnection`
and `pushesCodingMasters` as separate flags, but nothing can push coding masters without
holding the connection — two flags with one reachable combination is a flag too many.

The mode's `syncConfig` is a **ceiling, not a default**: `buildSpendSyncConfig` takes
`min(mode ceiling, stored toggles)`, so a settings save can narrow but never widen.
Defaulting the toggles off instead would let a later save silently re-enable an inbound
pull and recreate the double-count fixed on 2026-09-10.

Required-account validation and the healthcheck read the resolved config, not a mode:
`cardLiabilityAccountId` is required only when the `charge` entity resolves enabled, so
a push-only install is healthy without it.

**Mode is immutable after install.** Changing it means uninstall and reinstall.
Uninstall must **revoke the grant**, not merely drop Carbon's row: Google's grant does
not shrink by requesting fewer scopes (revoke plus `prompt=consent` is the documented
path) and Slack's scopes are purely additive; whether Ramp narrows on re-authorization
is unverified. Without a revoke, a reinstall "in push-only" could still hold
`accounting:write` while the UI says otherwise. Precedent for stating the constraint
rather than offering a migration: Stripe connected-account type, Shopify's QuickBooks
Desktop sync mode, BILL's 2-way bill sync.

`rampOnUninstall` must **not** delete the accounting connection when
`caps.ownsRemoteCodingSurface` is false — that connection belongs to the accounting
provider.

### 3. OAuth: mode chosen before consent

The authorize URL carries the scopes, so the mode must be chosen before the redirect.
Today `IntegrationCard.handleInstall` builds that URL in the browser from
`integration.oauth.scopes` and a state pre-issued by the integrations-list loader.

Replace that, for integrations declaring `modes`, with a server resource route
`GET /api/integrations/:id/connect?mode=…` that:

1. runs `requirePermissions(request, { update: "settings" })`,
2. rejects the connect when the role already has an active member (§1),
3. issues the OAuth state with `mode` in the **signed cookie payload**
   (`OAuthStatePayload` gains `mode?: string`),
4. redirects to the provider's authorize URL built server-side from that mode's scope
   set.

The callback's `consumeOAuthState` returns the stored payload so the mode can be
stamped onto metadata before `onInstall`. This removes the `integration.id === "ramp"`
special case in `IntegrationCard` and the `oauthStates` map in the integrations loader.

**Scope sets** (grounded in the per-endpoint `security` blocks of
`docs.ramp.com/openapi/developer-api.json`):

| | provider mode | push-only mode |
|---|---|---|
| `accounting:write` | ✅ | ❌ — the seat belongs to the accounting provider |
| `accounting:read` | ✅ | ✅ — enumerates the active provider's coding surface |
| `transactions:read`, `transfers:read`, `cashbacks:read`, `statements:read`, `receipts:read`, `reimbursements:read` | ✅ | ❌ |
| `bills:read` | ✅ | ✅ — bill payments and `BILL_SYNCED` |
| `bills:write`, `vendors:read`, `vendors:write`, `purchase_orders:read`, `purchase_orders:write`, `entities:read`, `business:read` | ✅ | ✅ |
| `item_receipts:write` | ✅ | ✅ (new) |

Per RFC 6749 §3.3 the authorization server may issue narrower scope than requested, so
**read the `scope` back from the token response and store it**; do not assume the
request was honoured. The Developer Console's configured list stays the superset of
both modes (Ramp's `invalid_scope` → "Requested scope not configured for app" enforces
this).

**Post-connect verification.** `GET /accounting/all-connections` needs only
`accounting:read` and returns `is_active` and `remote_provider_name` per connection.
Immediately after the callback, a push-only install confirms that another provider
holds the seat and records its name. If nobody holds it, or Carbon does, the
integration reports unhealthy with that reason rather than discovering it three bills
later.

Ramp does not *name* this role the way Brex (`ACCOUNTING` vs `ERP` field group), BILL
(AP & AR sync token) or Coupa (`third_party_partner`) do, and no surveyed product asks
for integration mode before OAuth consent at all. The setting copy says so plainly.

### 4. External identity resolution

One interface, in `packages/ee/src/accounting/core/external-identity.ts`:

```ts
export type ExternalIdentityKind = "account" | "vendor" | "costCenter" | "project";

export interface ExternalIdentityResolver {
  resolve(kind: ExternalIdentityKind, carbonId: string): Promise<string | null>;
  resolveMany(kind: ExternalIdentityKind, carbonIds: string[]): Promise<Map<string, string>>;
}
```

Two implementations, selected by `topology.identityScope(targetIntegrationId)` — never
by provider id, never by mode:

- `CarbonIdentityResolver` — returns the Carbon id. Today's behaviour, unchanged.
- `DelegatedIdentityResolver` — returns the identifier the delegate owns, read from
  `externalIntegrationMapping` under the delegate's `integration`, honouring that
  provider's declared `externalAddressing` for the kind.

**The selector is coding authority, not payables ownership.** An earlier draft keyed
this off §5, which is wrong even though the two coincide for Ramp today: the question
"whose identifiers does this target expect?" is answered by **who owns the target's
coding surface** (`ownsRemoteCodingSurface`), while §5 answers "who posts this GL
family". A spend platform that let Carbon push coding masters while the GL still posted
AP externally would break under the conflated rule — and that is precisely the
Brex/Coupa shape, where a partner role and the ERP role are separate registry entries.
Keeping them distinct costs one field and removes a latent bug.

So: `identityScope(target)` returns `delegated` when the target's coding surface is
owned by another installed integration, and `carbon` otherwise. Provider mode keeps
`carbon` for every target, which is why nothing changes there.

**Resolution is two hops, and both are needed.** The draft described the mapping table
and the live option read as if they were alternatives; they are stages of one pipeline:

1. **Translate** — Carbon account id → the delegate's identifier, from
   `externalIntegrationMapping` (`externalCode` or `externalId` per
   `externalAddressing`). This is the only hop that knows what the Carbon entity *is*.
2. **Validate** — confirm that identifier exists as an option on the target, from the
   live `GET /accounting/field-options` read. This is the only hop that knows what the
   target will *accept*.

A hit on (1) with a miss on (2) is drift (below). A miss on (1) is an unmapped account —
the accounting provider has never seen it, so there is nothing to translate to. Both
degrade the line to uncoded; only the reason code differs, and the distinction matters
because the fixes differ (map the account, versus re-push the chart of accounts).

The only per-provider knowledge is a declaration on the existing `ProviderCapabilities`
(`core/types.ts:90`), which already carries `transport` / `supportsWebhooks` /
`maxJournalDimensionSlots` and is the established extension point:

```ts
externalAddressing?: Partial<Record<ExternalIdentityKind, "id" | "code">>;
// rillet: { account: "code", vendor: "id" }
// xero:   { account: "code", vendor: "id" }
// qbo:    { account: "id",   vendor: "id" }
```

`"code"` reads the mapping's `metadata.externalCode`; `"id"` reads the `externalId`
column. Both already exist on every account-mapping row. This collapses the three
sibling loaders that differ only in which field they read — `loadAccountCodesById`
(Xero), `loadRilletAccountCodesById`, `loadQboAccountRefsById` — into one.
**Xero deliberately declares no `capabilities` at all**, so every read needs a
documented default (`"code"` for account, `"id"` otherwise) rather than an assumption.

**What is swapped and what is not.** Only *coding* identifiers — the GL account on each
line, and the vendor link. Carbon's own document identity stays Carbon's. This matters
concretely: Ramp's `remote_id` on a bill is documented as the id identifying the bill
on the **accounting-connection owner's** side, so in push-only mode Carbon must omit
it. That removes the current echo guard and bill-match key; replace with Ramp's own
documented bill dedupe, **vendor + `invoice_number`**, plus the Carbon-side mapping row
on the returned Ramp bill id.

**Vendors link through `accounting_vendor_remote_id`, not `external_vendor_id`.** Ramp
documents `external_vendor_id` as "independent of accounting system remote IDs" — a
caller's private handle, which is exactly what Carbon uses it for today and continues
to use it for. The field that lands a bill on the right GL vendor downstream is
`accounting_vendor_remote_id`, set via `PATCH /vendors/{id}`, pointing at the
*accounting vendor* the accounting provider created. Ramp's own guide calls confusing
Merchant / Vendor / Accounting Vendor "the most common integration error".

**Accounts resolve against the live remote surface.** `GET /accounting/fields`,
`/accounting/field-options` and `/accounting/accounts` need only `accounting:read` and
return the active provider's options with their ERP-sourced `external_id`. Read them on
**every sync run**, not only at install — mappings rot because customers keep editing
the chart of accounts, and Codat is the only unified-API vendor that names this and
says to re-validate continuously.

**Drift handling.** Re-reading first means most drift self-heals. What remains is a
genuinely deleted option: **degrade that line to uncoded and record a Warning naming
the account**, cleared automatically when the mapping resolves. Never park a bill on an
account — an uncoded bill still carries vendor, amount and invoice number, and a human
reviews the draft in Ramp regardless. The honest cost, which belongs in the Warning
copy: **coding is a creation-time affordance and cannot be fixed afterwards** —
`POST /accounting/codings` requires `accounting:write` and its `object_type` enum
contains only `TRANSACTION`, so it cannot code a bill at all. Vendors take the opposite
rule (§8): a wrong account is a bookkeeping correction, a wrong vendor is a duplicate
in the GL.

### 5. Ledger ownership (generalized beyond payables)

An earlier draft called this `PayablesOwnership`. That name encodes the one case we
have, not the concept. The general question is **who posts each GL family** — and
`postingSync.families` already exists to express exactly that. A billing platform owning
AR is the same shape; naming the abstraction after AP would guarantee a second, parallel
mechanism when it arrives.

**Key the ownership on the SETTINGS family keys, not on `PostingSourceFamily`.** The
policy discriminator is now `"ar" | "ap" | "per-line" | "per-party"`, and the last two
are *resolution strategies* — "resolve from the payment's control-account lines",
"resolve from the memo's party" — not families a company can own. The ownable set is
the keys of `postingSync.families`, which the credit-memo work grew to four:
`ar`, `ap`, `creditMemo`, `vendorCredit` (the two memo families defaulting to `"none"`,
since a family that has never synced has no correct backlog).

```ts
/** The OWNABLE families — the keys of `postingSync.families`. */
type LedgerFamilyKey = keyof PostingSyncSettings["families"];
  // "ar" | "ap" | "creditMemo" | "vendorCredit"

topology.ledgerOwnership: Record<LedgerFamilyKey, LedgerOwner>
```

A family is externally owned when the installed spend integration's mode declares it in
`ownsLedgerFamilies`. The §1 exclusivity constraint is what makes this unambiguous —
two spend integrations could otherwise claim the same family.

**The suppression is derived from `POSTING_POLICY`, not hard-coded to bills.** That
table already declares, per journal source type, its `family` and its
`backingEntityType`:

| Source type | family | backingEntityType |
|---|---|---|
| `Purchase Invoice` | `ap` | `bill` |
| `Reimbursement` | `ap` | `reimbursement` |
| `Purchase Return` | `ap` | `null` |
| `Sales Invoice` | `ar` | `invoice` |
| `Sales Return` | `ar` | `null` |
| `Credit Memo`, `Debit Memo` | `per-party` | `"per-party"` (sentinel) |
| `Payment` | `per-line` | `payment` |

So for each externally-owned family the rule is mechanical:

1. set `postingSync.families[family] = "none"` → every source type in that family
   records `Excluded / FAMILY_OFF`;
2. disable each **distinct `backingEntityType`** of that family in
   `syncConfig.entities`, skipping `null` and the `"per-party"` sentinel → the document
   push stops (`reconcileDocument` returns `nothing` on `entityPushEnabled` false); and
3. clear that entity's flag in `PostingSyncDocumentSyncFlags`
   (`billEnabled`, `reimbursementEnabled`, `invoiceEnabled`,
   `creditMemoEnabled`, `vendorCreditEnabled`) so the policy sees a consistent picture.
   Disabling the entity without clearing its flag is the `DOC_SYNC_DISABLED` pairing bug
   this section exists to prevent, one level down.

**Two sentinels are skipped, for the same reason.** A `per-line` family (`Payment`) is
shared between AR and AP and resolved per journal from its control-account lines;
a `per-party` family (the memos) is resolved per record from the memo's party
(`posting.ts:333-356`). Disabling either wholesale would break the side that is still
Carbon-owned. Both nuances are already handled by the existing `paymentFamily` /
`memoParty` resolution; the rule only has to not fight them.

**This rule has already been validated by a document type that did not exist when it
was written.** `Reimbursement` landed on this branch as `{ family: "ap",
backingEntityType: "reimbursement" }`. Delegating AP therefore disables **both `bill`
and `reimbursement`** — correctly, since in push-only mode reimbursements reach the GL
through the spend platform — and it does so with **no edit to this rule**. A version
that hard-coded `"bill"` would have silently kept pushing reimbursements to the GL
alongside the spend platform's copy. That is the argument for deriving from
`POSTING_POLICY`, and it is no longer hypothetical.

Both steps are required, and each alone is wrong. `families.ap = "none"` alone does
**not** stop the bill push — `reconcileDocument` never reads `families`, only
`entityPushEnabled`. And `entities.bill.enabled = false` alone parks a
`DOC_SYNC_DISABLED` Warning on every posted purchase invoice forever
(`posting.ts:370`). That pairing is the reason the rule lives in one derivation rather
than as two settings a human keeps in sync.

`families.ap = "none"` also disables payment syncback, which only runs in `documents`
mode — correct, since Carbon now learns about payment from the spend platform.

**Enforcement is a required argument, not a hidden overlay.** `resolveSyncConfig` and
`resolvePostingSyncSettings` gain a required `IntegrationTopology` parameter, making
every one of their ~12 call sites a compile error until it supplies one. Same "omission
is a compile error" idiom as `POSTING_POLICY`'s exhaustive `Record<>`. An overlay buried in
one loader would be silently missed by the call sites that read `row.metadata` from a
batch query.

An explicit manual override stays available in the Posting tab for customers who handle
AP elsewhere for reasons unrelated to a spend platform; when delegation is active the
control renders locked with the reason.

### 6. GR/IR

`post-receipt` credits `accountDefault.goodsReceivedNotInvoicedAccount`;
`post-purchase-invoice` clears it. **Carbon keeps posting the purchase invoice
locally, unchanged.** That is load-bearing twice over: it clears Carbon's own GRNI, and
it is where the outbound bill coding comes from — `loadBillCostingLines` replays the
posted "Purchase Invoice" journal because `purchaseInvoiceLine.accountId` is null for
item lines, and an invoice with no posted journal already fails the push today with
`UNMAPPED_ACCOUNTS`.

GRNI then clears in **both** ledgers independently:

- **Carbon** — the ordinary way, unchanged.
- **The GL** — it receives Carbon's `Purchase Receipt` journal (credit GRNI; still
  forwarded, since `families.ap = "none"` suppresses only AP *document* types, not
  journal-represented ones) and the spend platform's bill (debit GRNI, because Carbon
  coded that bill's lines from its own posted journal, where item lines already carry
  the GR-IR account).

Nothing is double-counted and nothing dangles. The real exposure is **recoding**: the
draft is editable in Ramp, so a human can move a line off GR-IR and the GL's GRNI never
clears. Detection: read the bill back once it reaches `BILL_SYNCED`, compare its coding
to what Carbon pushed, and raise a Warning on divergence. This is the reconciliation
signal, not a posting trigger.

No vendor documents a split GR/IR — every integration studied avoids it by keeping both
legs in one ledger — so this is Carbon's own position and the spec owns it.

### 7. Item receipts — DROPPED (2026-09-25)

**Designed here, built in slice 4, then removed the same day.** The argument below was
three-way match, and it does not hold: Carbon pushes the PO with
`three_way_match_enabled: false`, a value the research note records as a guess to
satisfy a required field ("a product decision — likely `false`"), not a finding. Both
cannot be the reason.

The only justification that would have survived is GR/IR — Carbon accrues
goods-received/invoice-received, the seat-holding system posts AP, and only it can clear
the accrual, and only if the receipt reaches it. But Carbon pushes to the spend platform,
not to the accounting provider, and **whether the platform relays item receipts to its
connected provider was never verified**. That is the question to answer first if this is
ever revisited; everything else is downstream of it.

Consequence: push-only's scope set is a strict SUBSET of provider mode's.
`packages/ee/src/ramp/scopes.test.ts` pins that. Note this was NOT driven by the Ramp
Developer Console — Carbon's app is already configured for `item_receipts:write`, so the
"manual console step" an earlier draft of this spec claimed was never a real cost. Not
requesting the scope is a deliberate choice: do not ask a customer to consent to a write
scope Carbon never exercises.

### 8. Master data: one resolution ladder, and a sweep

**The bug this fixes.** `RilletVendorSyncer.upsertRemote` has no name-matching lookup
before create — its own header says so. Its duplicate guards are the `carbon` external
reference and an idempotency key on `(companyId, "vendor", localId)`, both of which
prevent *Carbon* creating the same vendor twice and neither of which prevents Carbon
creating a vendor the provider already has. Only the *pull* path has a match ladder. So
a naive master-data sweep would mint a duplicate for every supplier a human already
created in the GL.

**Layer 1 — a shared counterpart-resolution ladder.** Hoist the ladder out of the pull
path into `resolveOrCreateRemoteCounterpart(kind, localEntity)`, run by the push path
*before* creating: mapping row → provider-side Carbon reference → unique strong key
(tax id, email) → unique exact name → create. **Ambiguity creates, never guesses** — a
duplicate is recoverable by merging, a wrong link silently posts one company's bills
against another company's vendor. `resolveOrCreateRampSpendVendor` already implements
exactly this ladder including the ambiguity rule, which is the sign it belongs in core.

Once both directions share the ladder, **ordering stops mattering**: whichever runs
first links rather than duplicates, and the import action becomes a convenience rather
than a precondition.

**Layer 2 — master data joins the outbound sweep.** `accounting-outbound-sweep`
(cron `15,45`) pages journals, purchase invoices, sales invoices, payments and charges
and no master data at all; the weekly reconciliation is posting-sync only. Master data
therefore has **no correctness guarantee** — a supplier predating the install, or whose
event was dropped, is never pushed. Add `customer` / `supplier` / `item`, driven by
**unmapped ∪ changed-since-cursor**:

- *unmapped* — `getUnsyncedEntityIds(entityType, tableName, integration, limit)` already
  exists on the mapping service; this set drains to zero and stays there;
- *changed since cursor* — the keyset cursor the document pages already use.

`reconcileMasterData`'s existing "unchanged since the last successful sync" check makes
steady state nearly free. Gated by the existing `isEntityPushEnabled`, so it is
provider-agnostic as written. Master data gets its own cadence (hourly; daily for
`item`, which can be six figures of rows where suppliers are hundreds).

**Layer 3 — one parameterized action.** `accounting-backfill` (push, wired only to a
Xero route) and `rillet-import-contacts` (pull, Rillet-only) collapse into one
`accounting-master-sync` taking `{ provider, entityTypes, direction }`, surfaced through
the `IntegrationAction` field the descriptor already supports so each provider declares
which directions it offers. QuickBooks and Xero gain the import button for free.

Per-provider declaration is only the search primitive, on the **shared** capability
surface (§1b) — because this is not an accounting-only concern:

```ts
// SharedCapabilities
searchableCounterparts?: ExternalIdentityKind[];
// SyncProvider
findRemoteCandidates(kind, { name, taxId, email }): Promise<RemoteCandidate[]>;
```

**Ramp implements it too, and that is the point.** `resolveOrCreateRampSpendVendor` is
already this ladder — mapping → external id → unique exact name → create, with
ambiguity falling through to create. It becomes an *implementation of*
`findRemoteCandidates`, so the ladder is literally one piece of shared code rather than a
pattern independently rediscovered per provider. A provider declaring an empty
`searchableCounterparts` simply always creates, which is today's Rillet push behaviour —
so the change is opt-in per provider and nothing regresses by default.

**Out of scope, noted:** deletes and archived remote records (nothing handles those
today either), and merging existing duplicates — this stops new ones, it does not clean
up what exists.

### 9. Decoupling: no cross-engine synchronous calls

The spend engine must never block on the accounting provider's HTTP round-trip: it
would inherit that provider's failure modes and rate limits and merge two retry
policies into one. The pull side already has the decoupled pattern — `dependsOnMapping`
lets a remote change declare the local mapping its processing depends on, and the sweep
silently skips it while that mapping is absent, picking it up once it appears. The
outbound path simply never got the equivalent.

**Precondition-and-defer.** The spend push checks whether the required mapping exists.
If not it enqueues the accounting-side push as an ordinary ledger operation, records a
Warning (`AWAITING_VENDOR_MAPPING`), and does not advance its own document. The two
engines communicate only through `externalIntegrationMapping` and the operation ledger —
which is how they already communicate for everything else.

**Differentiate by document.** A **purchase order** does not post to a GL, so it pushes
with the vendor link absent and is patched when the mapping appears. A **bill** waits,
because an unlinked spend vendor is precisely the duplicate-in-the-GL failure being
avoided. The common case never blocks.

**React to the mapping write.** When `externalIntegrationMapping` gains a
`(vendor, X, <accounting provider>)` row, re-reconcile the spend-pushable documents for
that entity. Turns "next sweep" into seconds.

`ensureDependencySynced` is lifted off `BaseEntitySyncer` into a free
`ensureEntitySyncedToAccounting(...)` over the public
`SyncFactory.getSyncer(...).pushToAccounting(...)` — used by the *deferred* enqueue path,
not as an inline call, and retiring the `(syncer as any).getRemoteId` cast.

### 10. Outbound moves onto the event engine

The spend integration's outbound half moves from cursor-driven paging to the shared
event pipeline (`attach_event_trigger` → `eventSystemSubscription` → `event-handler-sync`
→ `reconcile*` → operation ledger → `drainSyncOperations` → syncer). Inbound stays on
`ramp-sync` — its families key off the platform's own `SYNC_READY` status and confirm
protocol, with no Carbon row event to hang them on. That split is already the house
pattern: Xero, QuickBooks and Rillet all run events-out and `accounting-pull-sweep`
(cron `*/30`) in.

What it buys: deletes the bespoke `purchaseOrderPushUpdatedAt` /
`invoicePushUpdatedAt` keyset cursors (JSON-encoded `[updatedAt, id]` advancing only
across a contiguous successful prefix); reuses claim/retry semantics and the Sync
Activity inbox the spend integration already writes to; latency of seconds rather than
≤1h; and — the decisive part — the spend provider exposes `getSyncConfig(entity)`
derived from its mode capabilities and toggles, so push-only gating flows through the
**same `isEntityPushEnabled`** the accounting side uses. No parallel gate.

The work is widening `SyncContext.provider` off the closed `AccountingProvider` union
onto the `BaseProvider` shape (which mandates only `id`, `getSyncConfig`, `validate`,
`authenticate`), keying `SyncFactory` on a wider `SyncProviderID`, adding `itemReceipt`
to the entity union, and teaching `event-handler-sync` to resolve a sync provider rather
than specifically an accounting one. Each syncer keeps narrowing to its concrete
provider for its API client, as `this.rilletProvider` does today.

`purchaseOrder`, `purchaseInvoice` and `receipt` all already have event triggers, so
this is new subscription rows, not new triggers.

**Cost:** the outbound code is shared across modes, so this changes the shipped,
live-verified two-way integration too. PO push and draft-bill push were verified live on
2026-09-11 and are re-verified before merge.

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| **Capability surface** | One `SyncProviderCapabilities` discriminated on `role`, not a second vocabulary for spend | Two shapes would make every "can this provider do X?" question start with "which kind is it?" — the branching this spec exists to remove. `externalAddressing` and `searchableCounterparts` are shared because both roles need them. |
| **Per-entity enablement** | `GlobalSyncConfig` only; a mode contributes a ceiling fragment | The draft had `inbound`/`outbound` capability maps duplicating it. Two sources of truth for "does this entity sync?" is the defect. |
| **Company landscape** | One `IntegrationTopology`, resolved once and threaded | Replacing five ad-hoc lookups with four new ones is not an abstraction. Consumers ask about roles and ownership, never "is Rillet installed". |
| **Ledger delegation naming** | `ledgerOwnership: Record<LedgerFamilyKey, LedgerOwner>`, not `PayablesOwnership` | Naming it after AP guarantees a parallel mechanism when a billing platform owns AR. Keyed on the `postingSync.families` keys (now four: ar, ap, creditMemo, vendorCredit) — NOT `PostingSourceFamily`, whose `per-line`/`per-party` members are resolution strategies, not ownable families. |
| **Which entity to suppress** | Derived from `POSTING_POLICY`'s `family` + `backingEntityType`; `per-line` skipped | `bill` is a lookup result, not a constant. The same code resolves `ar → invoice` with no edit, and skipping `per-line` protects the AR half of a shared `Payment` journal. |
| **Identity-resolver selector** | Coding authority (`ownsRemoteCodingSurface`), not ledger ownership | They coincide for Ramp but answer different questions; a partner role that pushes coding while the GL posts AP externally (the Brex/Coupa shape) breaks under the conflated rule. |
| One integration with modes, or two integrations | One, with install modes | A second id needs a registry row plus parameterising ~92 hard-coded `"ramp"` literals (save routing, sweep `.eq("id","ramp")`, mapping namespace, `charge.integration` default, nav gate, plan whitelist). That forks the subsystem to change a scope string. |
| Where the mode is chosen | Before consent, server-side resource route, mode in the signed OAuth state | The authorize URL carries the scopes. Requesting `accounting:write` and promising not to use it is the wrong trade when the whole point is that the customer wants another provider to own accounting. |
| Mode mutability | Immutable; uninstall (with revoke) to change | Re-authorizing with fewer scopes may union rather than narrow (Google, Slack); without a revoke the UI would lie about the granted set. Precedent: Stripe account type, Shopify QBD sync mode, BILL 2-way bill sync. |
| Which identifiers swap | Coding identifiers only (account, vendor); document identity stays Carbon's | `remote_id` belongs to the accounting-connection owner; overwriting Carbon's document identity would break the bill-payment round-trip. |
| Vendor link field | `accounting_vendor_remote_id`, not `external_vendor_id` | `external_vendor_id` is documented as independent of accounting remote ids. Carbon keeps using it as its own match key. |
| Account identifier source | Read the active provider's field options live from the spend platform each run | `accounting:read` returns ERP-sourced `external_id`s. Mappings rot as customers edit the chart of accounts. |
| Drift on a deleted option | Degrade line to uncoded + Warning; never park | Coding is creation-time only and cannot be repaired, but an uncoded bill still flows and a human reviews it. Parking holds real payables hostage to a bookkeeping edit. |
| Missing vendor mapping | Block the bill, defer, Warning; PO pushes unlinked | Unmapped is the *normal* state for pre-existing suppliers, not an edge case. A duplicate GL vendor is not recoverable without cleanup; a late bill is. |
| Payables suppression | Both `entities.bill.enabled = false` and `families.ap = "none"`, derived | Each alone is wrong (see §5). Derived cannot drift; a required resolver argument makes omission a compile error. |
| GR/IR | Keep local posting; stop forwarding AP; verify via `BILL_SYNCED` | Local posting is load-bearing for the outbound coding and clears Carbon's own GRNI. The GL's GRNI clears from the receipt journal plus the coded bill. |
| Cross-engine coupling | Precondition-and-defer via the ledger | Mirrors the shipped `dependsOnMapping` pull-side pattern; no engine inherits another provider's failure modes. |
| **Outbound transport** | The shared event pipeline for outbound; the sweep stays for inbound | Already the house pattern (Xero/QBO/Rillet run events-out, `accounting-pull-sweep` in). Deletes the bespoke keyset cursors, reuses claim/retry and the Sync Activity inbox the spend integration already writes to, and — decisively — lets the spend provider expose `getSyncConfig(entity)` so push-only gating flows through the same `isEntityPushEnabled` as everything else, instead of a parallel `metadata.sync.push*` gate in the reconciler. |
| Why not build on the sweep first | Rejected | The cursor-advancement logic would be written and then deleted; and the capability→`GlobalSyncConfig` mapping that makes the mode gating generic only exists on the event path. |
| Exclusivity enforcement | DB trigger on `companyIntegration`, keyed on `providerRole` | Too many write paths (settings upsert, patch RPC, OAuth callbacks) to guard in app code, several under service-role. |
| **H1 Multi-tenancy** | No new tenant tables; `integration.providerRole` is registry-global, `companyIntegration` keeps its `("id","companyId")` PK | Nothing new is per-tenant. |
| **H2 Service shape** | New service functions take `client` first and return `{data, error}`; ee entitlement helpers keep their throw contract | Matches `conventions-services.md` and the existing ee split. |
| **H3 RLS** | No new tables ⇒ no new policies. `integration` is a global registry with existing policies | Verified: the change is one nullable column. |
| **H4 Permission scoping** | Connect route uses `requirePermissions(request, { update: "settings" })`, matching the existing callback | Same scope the OAuth callback already requires. |
| **H5 Form pattern** | The mode picker is a dialog that navigates to a resource route, not a `ValidatedForm` mutation; the posting/AP settings keep their existing `ValidatedForm` + zod validator | The mode is not persisted state at that point — it is a parameter of a redirect. |
| **H6 Module layout** | `packages/ee/src/spend/` mirrors `accounting/`; no ERP module gains a second service/models file | Ramp UI stays in `apps/erp/app/modules/invoicing/ui/Charge/`. |
| **H7 Backward compatibility** | `providerRole`, `externalAddressing`, `modes` and `supportsMasterDataImport` are all **optional** with documented defaults | Xero declares no `capabilities` at all; an integration with no `providerRole` is unconstrained. Existing installs read as `mode: "provider"` when unset. |

## Data Model Changes

No new tables. Two schema changes plus metadata-only additions.

```sql
-- 1. Declare the role on the registry, denormalized from the TS descriptors so a
--    trigger can read it without a join to application code.
ALTER TABLE "integration"
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS "providerRole" TEXT;

DO $$
BEGIN
  IF NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM pg_constraint WHERE conname = 'integration_providerRole_check'
  ) THEN
    ALTER TABLE "integration"
      ADD CONSTRAINT "integration_providerRole_check"
      CHECK ("providerRole" IS NULL OR "providerRole" IN ('accounting', 'spend'));
  END IF;
END $$;

UPDATE "integration" SET "providerRole" = 'accounting'
  WHERE id IN ('xero', 'quickbooks', 'rillet') AND "providerRole" IS DISTINCT FROM 'accounting';
UPDATE "integration" SET "providerRole" = 'spend'
  WHERE id = 'ramp' AND "providerRole" IS DISTINCT FROM 'spend';

-- 2. One active integration per role per company. Fires only on INSERT and on a
--    false -> true transition, so an existing company already in violation is not
--    retroactively invalidated (it simply cannot activate a third).
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.check_single_active_provider_role()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
DECLARE
  v_role TEXT;
  v_conflict TEXT;
BEGIN
  IF NEW."active" IS NOT TRUE THEN
    RETURN NEW;
  END IF;
  IF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' AND OLD."active" IS TRUE THEN
    RETURN NEW;
  END IF;

  SELECT "providerRole" INTO v_role FROM "integration" WHERE id = NEW."id";
  IF v_role IS NULL THEN
    RETURN NEW;
  END IF;

  SELECT ci."id" INTO v_conflict
  FROM "companyIntegration" ci
  JOIN "integration" i ON i.id = ci."id"
  WHERE ci."companyId" = NEW."companyId"
    AND ci."active" IS TRUE
    AND ci."id" <> NEW."id"
    AND i."providerRole" = v_role
  LIMIT 1;

  IF v_conflict IS NOT NULL THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION
      'Only one active % integration is allowed per company; % is already active',
      v_role, v_conflict
      USING ERRCODE = '23505';
  END IF;

  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS "companyIntegration_single_active_role" ON "companyIntegration";
CREATE TRIGGER "companyIntegration_single_active_role"
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE OF "active" ON "companyIntegration"
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.check_single_active_provider_role();
```

Pre-existing violations are reported, not repaired:

```sql
SELECT ci."companyId", i."providerRole", array_agg(ci."id" ORDER BY ci."id")
FROM "companyIntegration" ci
JOIN "integration" i ON i.id = ci."id"
WHERE ci."active" IS TRUE AND i."providerRole" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1, 2 HAVING count(*) > 1;
```

**Metadata additions** (no DDL — `companyIntegration.metadata`):

- spend integration: `syncMode` (`"provider" | "push-only"`, absent ⇒ `"provider"`),
  `grantedScopes` (string array read back from the token response),
  `accountingConnectionProvider` (the `remote_provider_name` observed post-connect),
  `cursors.billSyncStatusCheckedAt`.
- accounting integration: unchanged. Payables delegation is derived, never stored.

**Mapping rows** (`externalIntegrationMapping`, no DDL): the spend integration writes a
new `entityType: "accountingFieldOption"` scoped to its own `integration`, recording the
Carbon account/cost-center/project id against the active provider's option external id,
refreshed each run.

**Event subscriptions** (`eventSystemSubscription` rows, no DDL — written by
`ensureProviderSubscriptions`, never by a migration). The spend integration gains a
subscription set named `${providerId}-sync`, converged on install, on every settings
save, and by the sweep — the same lifecycle the accounting sets already have:

| Table | Operations | Entity | Runs when |
|---|---|---|---|
| `purchaseOrder` | INSERT, UPDATE | `purchaseOrder` | `caps.outbound.purchaseOrder` |
| `receipt` | INSERT, UPDATE | `itemReceipt` | `caps.outbound.itemReceipt` |
| `purchaseInvoice` | INSERT, UPDATE | `bill` | `caps.outbound.bill` |

All three tables already carry `attach_event_trigger` (`purchaseOrder` and `receipt`
from `20260119084845` / `20260218000000`; `purchaseInvoice` is in `COMMON_PUSH_TABLES`),
so **no migration attaches a trigger**. DELETE is deliberately unsubscribed — the
handler logs and skips it, and a spend platform's document lifecycle is not Carbon's to
retract.

Two non-DDL shape changes ride with it: `TABLE_TO_ENTITY_MAP` gains
`receipt: "itemReceipt"` (a table in `REQUIRED_SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS` with no entry here is
a dead letter — pinned by `subscriptions-mapping.test.ts`), and `AccountingEntityType`
gains `itemReceipt`, which makes it a compile error for any provider's
`build*SyncConfig` and for `DEFAULT_SYNC_CONFIG` to omit a decision for it.

## API / Service Changes

**`packages/ee/src/types.ts`** — `IntegrationConfig` gains
`providerRole?: "accounting" | "spend"` and `modes?: InstallMode[]`.

**`packages/ee/src/sync/`** (new, role-neutral — see the naming note below) —
`capabilities.ts` (`SyncProviderCapabilities`, the discriminated union + its documented
defaults), `topology.ts` (`IntegrationTopology`, `resolveIntegrationTopology`,
`LedgerOwner`, `IdentityScope`), `identity.ts` (`ExternalIdentityResolver`,
`CarbonIdentityResolver`, `DelegatedIdentityResolver`), `counterpart.ts`
(`resolveOrCreateRemoteCounterpart`, shared by both directions, both roles, and the
deferred JIT path).

**`packages/ee/src/spend/`** (new) — `types.ts` (`SpendProviderID`, `InstallMode`,
`SpendProviderDescriptor`), `registry.ts` (`SPEND_PROVIDERS`), `sync-config.ts`
(`buildSpendSyncConfig` — the mode ceiling ∧ stored toggles).

**`packages/ee/src/accounting/core/types.ts`** — `ProviderCapabilities` is replaced by
the shared `SyncProviderCapabilities` (re-exported under the old name for the three
accounting providers); `SyncContext.provider` widens to `SyncProvider`;
`ensureDependencySynced` is extracted to a free function.

**`packages/ee/src/accounting/core/service.ts`** — `resolveSyncConfig` and
`resolvePostingSyncSettings` gain a required `IntegrationTopology` argument;
`getAccountingIntegration` keeps its signature. The four hard-coded provider-id lists
(`ACCOUNTING_SYNC_INTEGRATION_IDS`, the inline `_layout.tsx` literal,
`Object.values(ProviderID)` in three sweeps, and `category === "Accounting"`) are all
replaced by topology reads.

**Naming debt, stated not paid.** `packages/ee/src/accounting/core/` now hosts machinery
that serves both roles — `SyncFactory`, `BaseEntitySyncer`, the mapping service, the
reconciler — and the vocabulary follows suit (`AccountingEntityType`,
`pushBatchToAccounting`, `pullBatchFromAccounting`). The honest shape is a role-neutral
`sync` core with accounting and spend providers layered on top. This spec puts **new**
surfaces in `packages/ee/src/sync/` with neutral names and adds `SyncEntityType` as an
alias of `AccountingEntityType`, but does **not** rename the existing exports — that is
mechanical churn across three providers and the jobs package, and it would bury the
behavioural change in a diff nobody can review. Tracked as a follow-up.

**`packages/ee/src/ramp/`** — `scopes.ts` exports per-mode sets;
`config.tsx` declares `providerRole: "spend"` and `modes`; `hooks.server.ts` branches on
capabilities; `lib/spend.ts` gains `linkAccountingVendor`; `lib/coding.ts`
`buildLineCodingSelections` takes resolved option ids rather than pushed-id sets;
new `lib/item-receipts.ts`.

**`apps/erp/app/routes/api+/integrations.$id.connect.ts`** (new) — permission check,
exclusivity check, state issue with mode, redirect.

**`packages/auth/src/lib/oauth-state.server.ts`** — `OAuthStatePayload` gains
`mode?: string`; `consumeOAuthState` returns the stored payload alongside `{valid, cookie}`.

**`packages/jobs/.../accounting-outbound-sweep.ts`** — master-data pages.
**`packages/jobs/.../accounting-master-sync.ts`** (new) — replaces
`accounting-backfill` and `rillet-import-contacts`.

### Moving outbound onto the event engine

The widening, smallest-blast-radius first:

- **`packages/ee/src/accounting/core/sync.ts`** — `SyncFactory.register` / `getSyncer`
  key on `SyncProviderID` (`ProviderID | SpendProviderID`) instead of `ProviderID`.
  The registry lookup is already the one provider-agnostic dispatch point; only its key
  type changes.
- **`packages/ee/src/accounting/core/types.ts`** — `SyncContext.provider` widens from
  the closed `AccountingProvider` union to a `SyncProvider` interface carrying the
  `BaseProvider` mandatory surface (`id`, `getSyncConfig`, `validate`, `authenticate`).
  Each syncer keeps narrowing to its concrete provider for its API client, exactly as
  `this.rilletProvider` does today.
- **`packages/ee/src/ramp/lib/provider.ts`** (new) — a `RampProvider` satisfying
  `SyncProvider`, whose `getSyncConfig(entity)` is derived from
  `buildSpendSyncConfig(mode, metadata)`: the mode's capabilities decide `enabled`, the
  stored toggles can only narrow further, and `direction` is always
  `push-to-accounting`. **This is the piece that makes the mode gating generic** —
  `isEntityPushEnabled` then governs the spend integration with no new gate.
- **`packages/ee/src/spend/`** (new) — the provider-NEUTRAL half of every spend push,
  following the convention the accounting providers already use (`document-costing.ts`,
  `sales-invoice-source.ts`, `card-charge-source.ts` each feed three adapters):
  `push-only-syncer.ts` (`SpendPushOnlyEntitySyncer` — a spend platform's outbound
  documents are push-only by construction, because its inbound families arrive through
  its own status feed with no Carbon row event to hang a syncer on), `parties.ts` (the
  supplier / purchasing-contact / address load), `purchase-order-source.ts`,
  `bill-source.ts`, `item-receipt-source.ts`, `gates.ts` (which documents are eligible)
  and `sync-config.ts`. Every one of these is a statement about CARBON's schema and
  lifecycle, so a second platform shares them unchanged.
- **`packages/ee/src/ramp/entities/`** (new) — `purchase-order.ts`, `item-receipt.ts`,
  `bill.ts`: the WIRE only. Payload field names, idempotency mechanics, the coding
  selection shape, and rules that are genuinely the platform's (Ramp's draft bill is
  create-once BECAUSE a Ramp draft has no delete endpoint). Plus `rampSyncerRegistry` +
  `SyncFactory.register(...)` in the barrel, mirroring `providers/rillet/index.ts`.
  These absorb the bodies of today's `pushPurchaseOrder` / `pushInvoiceDraftBill`.

  **Measured on the slice-3 landing:** 870 lines written Ramp-first became 413 lines of
  Ramp plus a shared core — only ~38 lines touched the Ramp wire. A second platform
  (Brex, Navan, Airbase) reimplements the adapters and nothing else. What was
  deliberately NOT abstracted is the capability axes (`archivesSettledPurchaseOrders`,
  `billLifecycle`, `requiresVendorOn`): inventing them from one implementation encodes
  Ramp's shape under a generic name. They stay as documented rules in the adapter until
  a second provider can falsify them.
- **`packages/ee/src/accounting/core/subscriptions.ts`** — `REQUIRED_SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS`
  keys on `SyncProviderID` and gains the spend entry; `ensureProviderSubscriptions`
  converges it on install, settings save and sweep, unchanged otherwise.
- **`packages/jobs/.../events/sync-tables.ts`** — `TABLE_TO_ENTITY_MAP` gains
  `receipt: "itemReceipt"`.
- **`packages/jobs/.../events/sync.ts`** — resolves a **sync** provider rather than
  calling `getAccountingIntegration(companyId, provider as ProviderID)`; the
  `companyId:provider` grouping and the reconcile/drain steps are untouched.
- **`packages/jobs/.../integrations/reconcile.ts`** — `computeReconcileDecision` routes
  `itemReceipt` to `reconcileDocument` (its checks are `entityPushEnabled`,
  `hasLiveOperation` and the mapping/unchanged pair — the posting policy lives on the
  `journalEntry` path and is not reached).
- **`packages/jobs/.../integrations/ramp-sync-outbound.ts`** — **deleted**, along with
  `decodeRampKeysetCursor` / `rampKeysetFilter` and the
  `cursors.purchaseOrderPushUpdatedAt` / `cursors.invoicePushUpdatedAt` metadata slots.
  `ramp-sync` keeps only its inbound steps and their confirm calls.

### Keeping the abstraction honest

An abstraction that nothing enforces decays back into id checks. Two guards, both cheap:

- **A `@carbon/checks` conformance rule, `no-integration-id-branching`** — a string
  literal equal to a registered integration id, used in a comparison or a set/array
  literal, outside `packages/ee/src/<that-integration>/**` and the registry files, is a
  finding. The existing baseline mechanism absorbs the sites this spec does not convert
  (`charge.integration` defaults, error-copy maps, `SECRET_KEYS`, the server-hooks
  registry — all legitimately id-keyed), so the rule guards new code rather than
  demanding a big-bang cleanup.
- **Extend `subscriptions-mapping.test.ts`** to close the loop it half-closes today:
  every table in `REQUIRED_SYNC_SUBSCRIPTIONS` must have a `TABLE_TO_ENTITY_MAP` entry
  (already asserted) **and** a syncer registered for that provider, and every
  `ExternalIdentityKind` a provider lists in `searchableCounterparts` must have a
  `findRemoteCandidates` implementation. A provider added without those is a dead
  letter today and a test failure after.

**Not moved, deliberately:** the inbound families and `confirmSyncs`. They key off the
platform's own `SYNC_READY` status and its batched confirm protocol, with no Carbon row
event to hang them on, so `ramp-sync` remains the correctness guarantee for inbound —
the same division Xero, QuickBooks and Rillet already run.

## UI Changes

- **Integrations list** — Install on a spend integration opens a mode dialog
  (two cards: "Carbon is my accounting system" / "Another system posts my ledger"),
  then navigates to the connect route. Install is disabled, with copy naming the
  incumbent, when the role already has an active member.
- **Integration details** — mode rendered read-only with an explanatory line naming the
  accounting provider observed at connect; a "Reconnect in a different mode" control
  that explains it requires uninstalling first. The Accounts group and the three
  inbound toggles are hidden in push-only mode (`visibleWhen`-style capability gating).
- **Posting tab** — the AP family select renders locked with "Payables are handled by
  <provider>" when delegated; the manual override remains for the non-delegated case.
- **Sync Activity** — new Warning reasons `AWAITING_VENDOR_MAPPING`,
  `CODING_OPTION_MISSING`, `BILL_RECODED_EXTERNALLY`, each clearing on resolution.
- **Invoicing nav** — Charges is hidden when the installed spend provider's
  capabilities declare no inbound transactions, replacing `integrations.has("ramp")`.
- **New i18n strings** run through `/translate` before merge.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] With Rillet active, installing the spend integration offers a mode choice; choosing
      push-only opens an authorize URL whose `scope` omits `accounting:write` and includes
      `item_receipts:write`.
- [ ] After a push-only connect, `companyIntegration.metadata.syncMode` is `"push-only"`,
      `grantedScopes` reflects the token response, and no Ramp accounting connection was
      created (`GET /accounting/connection` still reports Rillet).
- [ ] Attempting to install QuickBooks while Rillet is active is blocked in the UI, and a
      direct `POST` that would activate it raises the trigger's exception.
- [ ] A purchase order for a supplier with no accounting-provider mapping pushes to Ramp
      **without** a vendor link, and the link is patched on the next run after the vendor
      mapping appears.
- [ ] A purchase invoice for that same supplier does **not** push until the mapping exists;
      it shows one `AWAITING_VENDOR_MAPPING` Warning, which disappears once it does.
- [ ] A pushed draft bill carries no `remote_id`, its vendor resolves through
      `accounting_vendor_remote_id`, and each line's `field_option_external_id` equals the
      Rillet-sourced option id — not the Carbon `account.id`.
- [ ] Posting that purchase invoice creates a Carbon journal as before, produces **no**
      Rillet Bill, and records the AP journal as `Excluded / FAMILY_OFF` rather than a
      `DOC_SYNC_DISABLED` Warning.
- [ ] Deleting the coded account in Rillet makes the next push emit that line uncoded with
      a `CODING_OPTION_MISSING` Warning; the bill still reaches Ramp.
- [ ] A supplier created before the integration was installed is picked up by the
      master-data sweep and linked — not duplicated — to the identically-named Rillet vendor.
- [ ] Running the import action twice produces no duplicate suppliers or customers.
- [ ] Receiving against the PO pushes an item receipt referencing the PO's line items.
- [ ] Releasing a purchase order enqueues a `purchaseOrder` operation on the shared ledger
      **within seconds**, with the hourly spend sweep stopped — proving the push is
      event-driven and no longer cursor-driven.
- [ ] `ramp-sync-outbound.ts` and the `purchaseOrderPushUpdatedAt` /
      `invoicePushUpdatedAt` cursor slots no longer exist, and an install whose metadata
      still carries those slots syncs correctly (they are ignored, not migrated).
- [ ] Installing the spend integration creates its `${providerId}-sync`
      `eventSystemSubscription` rows for `purchaseOrder`, `receipt` and `purchaseInvoice`;
      uninstalling removes them; re-saving settings converges them without churning rows.
- [ ] Turning off the spend integration's purchase-order toggle makes
      `isEntityPushEnabled` false for `purchaseOrder`, and a released PO is reconciled to
      "push disabled in the sync config" with no ledger row — i.e. the mode/toggle gating
      runs through the same path the accounting providers use.
- [ ] A `receipt` row event with no `TABLE_TO_ENTITY_MAP` entry would fail
      `subscriptions-mapping.test.ts`; that test passes with the new entry.
- [ ] Inbound families still run on `ramp-sync`, and their confirm batches are unaffected.

**The abstraction itself** — these are the criteria that fail if it is a veneer:

- [ ] A test fixture declaring a second, fictitious spend provider (descriptor + one
      `InstallMode` + a syncer registry) installs, pushes a purchase order, and is
      blocked by exclusivity against the first — **with no edit to any file outside its
      own fixture directory**.
- [ ] A fixture mode declaring `ownsLedgerFamilies: ["ar"]` disables
      `entities.invoice` and sets `families.ar = "none"`, derived from `POSTING_POLICY`,
      with no code change — proving the rule is not AP-shaped.
- [ ] A fixture mode declaring `ownsLedgerFamilies: ["ap"]` and
      `ownsRemoteCodingSurface: true` delegates payables **without** swapping identifiers,
      proving §4's selector and §5's ownership are genuinely independent.
- [ ] `resolveIntegrationTopology` issues no database query beyond the cached
      `getCompanyIntegrations` read, and is the only source consulted by
      `resolveSyncConfig` / `resolvePostingSyncSettings`.
- [ ] `no-integration-id-branching` passes with the agreed baseline, and adding a bare
      `integrationId === "ramp"` comparison to a jobs or ERP file fails it.
- [ ] A provider registered with a subscribed table but no matching syncer, or a
      `searchableCounterparts` entry with no `findRemoteCandidates`, fails
      `subscriptions-mapping.test.ts`.
- [ ] Recoding a line in Ramp away from GR-IR raises `BILL_RECODED_EXTERNALLY` after the
      bill reaches `BILL_SYNCED`.
- [ ] Paying the bill in Ramp settles the Carbon purchase invoice, matched on vendor plus
      invoice number.
- [ ] In **provider** mode every behaviour above is unchanged from today: Carbon ids are
      coded, `remote_id` is sent, all inbound families run, charges appear in the nav.
- [ ] `pnpm exec turbo run typecheck --filter=@carbon/ee --filter=@carbon/jobs --filter=erp`,
      `pnpm run lint`, `pnpm run test` all pass; `pnpm db:check:datasets` and
      `pnpm db:check:backups` pass.

## Risks

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|
| Ramp silently drops an unrecognised `field_option_external_id` → uncoded bills with no error | High | Sandbox-verified before build (gate 1). If it drops silently, validate every option against the live read and refuse to send unknown ones. |
| A non-provider app cannot read `/accounting/field-options` at all | High | Sandbox-verified (gate 2). If blocked, fall back to resolving from Carbon's own accounting-provider mapping and accept the extra unverifiability. |
| Moving outbound to the event engine regresses the shipped two-way integration | High | Re-run the 2026-09-11 live verification for PO push and draft-bill push before merge; capability-gated so provider mode's behaviour is unchanged by construction. |
| Widening `SyncContext.provider` touches a load-bearing type across three providers | Medium | Widen to the existing `BaseProvider` shape rather than inventing one; each syncer keeps narrowing to its concrete provider, as today. |
| Master-data sweep pushes duplicates | Medium | The shared ladder (§8 layer 1) lands **before** the sweep (§8 layer 2); enforced by task ordering in the plan. |
| `accounting_vendor_remote_id` uniqueness collides with a link the provider already made | Medium | Sandbox-verified (gate 4). Treat a collision as "already linked" and adopt it rather than failing. |
| Item-master sweep is expensive at six-figure row counts | Low | Unmapped set drains to zero; changed-set rides a cursor; `item` runs daily, not on the 30-minute beat. |
| A company already has two active accounting integrations | Low | The trigger only guards new activations; a report query identifies existing violations for manual cleanup. |

## Open Questions

> Resolved with the user before this spec was written. Recorded as the audit trail.

- [x] Should push-only bills be uncoded, or coded with the accounting provider's ids? —
      **Answer:** coded with the accounting provider's ids, resolved through
      `externalIntegrationMapping`, with a generalized abstraction and no per-provider
      branching.
- [x] How does Carbon learn a bill was paid? — **Answer:** pull bill payments from the
      spend platform, not from the accounting provider.
- [x] Is the mode switchable after install? — **Answer:** no; uninstall and reinstall.
- [x] Are purchase orders still pushed in push-only mode? — **Answer:** yes.
- [x] Does Carbon still receive reimbursements? — **Answer:** no; they go spend → GL
      directly and Carbon never sees them.
- [x] Is the AP-off setting Rillet-specific or general? — **Answer:** general across all
      accounting providers, and automatically applied when any spend integration is in
      push-only mode.
- [x] Should the spend and accounting settings be coupled? — **Answer:** yes, through the
      abstraction — derived, never hard-coded per provider pair.
- [x] What happens when a mapping is missing? — **Answer:** vendor blocks and defers;
      account degrades to uncoded.
- [x] Derived or stored payables delegation? — **Answer:** derived, with a required
      resolver argument so no call site can miss it.
- [x] GR/IR treatment? — **Answer:** keep the accrual and verify against `BILL_SYNCED`;
      refined during design to keep Carbon's local AP posting, which is load-bearing for
      the outbound coding.
- [x] Drift when the chart of accounts changes? — **Answer:** re-read before every push;
      degrade to uncoded with a Warning; never park a bill on an account.
- [x] Master-data catch-up? — **Answer:** in scope, plus generalizing the existing
      Rillet-only import action to every accounting provider.
- [x] Should outbound move to the event engine? — **Answer:** yes, for all modes;
      inbound stays on the sweep.
- [x] Cross-engine coupling? — **Answer:** precondition-and-defer, POs push unlinked,
      re-reconcile on mapping write. No synchronous calls.
- [x] Exclusivity? — **Answer:** exactly one active accounting integration and one active
      spend integration per company.

### Verification gates — sandbox before build

Two unknowns gate the coding half and are sequenced first in the plan. Neither gates the
vendor half or the payables-suppression half, which can proceed regardless.

1. Does Ramp **validate** `field_external_id` / `field_option_external_id` against the
   active connection's options, and what happens on a miss — reject, silent drop, or
   accept?
2. Can an app that does **not** own the accounting connection read
   `GET /accounting/fields`, `/accounting/field-options` and `/accounting/accounts`?
3. Is `sync_status` / `BILL_SYNCED` readable with `bills:read` by a non-provider app?
4. Can a caller with only `vendors:write` set `accounting_vendor_remote_id` pointing at
   an accounting vendor another app created, and what happens when it is already linked?
5. Does omitting `remote_id` on a draft bill change anything in Ramp's export downstream?

## Changelog

- 2026-09-23: Created. Research in `.ai/research/spend-management-one-way-push.md`;
  all open questions resolved with the user before writing.
- 2026-09-23: Abstraction pass. Collapsed the separate `SpendCapabilities` shape into one
  `SyncProviderCapabilities` discriminated on `role`; removed the `inbound`/`outbound`
  capability maps as duplicates of `GlobalSyncConfig`; introduced `IntegrationTopology` in
  place of four separate resolvers; renamed `PayablesOwnership` to `ledgerOwnership` over
  `PostingSourceFamily` and derived the suppressed entity from `POSTING_POLICY` rather than
  hard-coding `bill`; re-keyed the identity resolver on coding authority rather than ledger
  ownership; made the counterpart ladder a shared capability both roles implement; added the
  `no-integration-id-branching` conformance rule and abstraction-level acceptance criteria;
  recorded the `accounting/core` naming debt as a stated follow-up.
- 2026-09-24: Reconciled with the two-way sync work that landed on the branch (credit
  memos, vendor credits, reimbursements-as-documents) — see
  `.ai/runs/2026-09-24-two-way-sync-branch-state.md`. Re-keyed `ledgerOwnership` off
  `PostingSourceFamily` onto the `postingSync.families` keys (now four); added the
  `per-party` sentinel to the skip rule beside `per-line`; added step 3 clearing the
  matching `PostingSyncDocumentSyncFlags` entry; and recorded that `Reimbursement`
  (`family: "ap"`, `backingEntityType: "reimbursement"`) validated the
  POSTING_POLICY-derived suppression with no edit — a hard-coded `"bill"` would have
  kept pushing reimbursements to the GL alongside the spend platform's copy.
